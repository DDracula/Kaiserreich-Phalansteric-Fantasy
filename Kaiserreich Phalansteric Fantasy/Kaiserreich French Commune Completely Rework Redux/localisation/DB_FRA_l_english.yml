Ongoing internal debates over economic direction have hindered a cohesive model. Although Black Monday didn’t directly impact us, we must seize this moment to reshape our economic system through direct action while capitalism is in crisis.\n\nIn 1936, we must resolve our economic differences. Whether it’s the Jacobins’ planned economy, the Sorelian corporatist economy, the orthodox syndicalist economy, or even the mutualist economy of the anarchists, the key is to forge a cohesive and organic system guided by the collective will of the working class.

Nationwide strikes and socialist uprisings dismantled the decaying bourgeois republic, and the newly formed Federation of the French Commune had to sign an armistice with the Germans to ensure the revolution's survival. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) has served as the backbone of revolutionary forces since the civil war, and after its conclusion, the CGT attempted to draft a new people's alliance constitution with socialists, anarchists, Jacobins, and radical liberals. Through negotiations and compromises, the Commune's politics were established with a dual structure: the Legislative Labor Council and the Executive Committee of Public Safety.\n\nDespite its claim of being a free and democratic socialist and syndicalist federal republic, the CGT practically monopolizes most political positions, and competitors have never truly challenged the CGT's dominance since the Commune's establishment. Even if the opposition gains control of the Committee of Public Safety, the Labor Council remains under the CGT's control, making it difficult for the opposition government to implement policies contrary to CGT views.\n\nHowever, factions exist within the CGT itself. Since Marcel Pivert formed an 'unstable' compromise government in 1931, tensions within the CGT have only increased. Currently, an impeachment motion against Pivert is under review by the General Council. If it proceeds, Pivert may soon be ousted by his comrades, and the Commune's political scene will face a true crossroads."

Although most are syndicalists, differences still exist among them. After Pivert’s compromise government, criticisms have emerged within the Syndicalist Bloc against Pivert. Meanwhile, tensions have risen between the Radical Faction led by Pierre Monatte and the Committee Faction led by Marcel Cachin. Ultimately, Cachin and his colleagues left the CGT, and some opposition members left the Syndicalist Bloc's 'big tent.'\n\nCurrently, the two main factions within the Syndicalist Bloc are the Moderate Faction, led by Léon Jouhaux, who seeks to maintain the Syndicalist Bloc's big-tent status with a moderate reform stance, and the Radical Faction, led by Pierre Monatte and Benoît Frachon, who are dissatisfied with the status quo and seek to expand the CGT’s authority through radical syndicalist reforms.\n\nThough the factions differ on reform strategies, the Syndicalist Bloc overall still aims to maintain or increase CGT's influence, marking a major point of contention with other factions."

  frapoc.12.title:0 "Anarchist Bloc: The Opposition Alliance"
  frapoc.12.desc:0 "The 'Anarchist Bloc' is not a traditional anarchist bloc. It primarily consists of the Committee Faction, which split from the Syndicalist Bloc, and the original anarchist alliance. The Committee Faction, led by Marcel Cachin, calls for limiting the CGT's powers and easing the Labor Council's strict legislative requirements. They believe these centralized actions betray syndicalism and socialism, forming a new bureaucratic union monopoly. They favor the British decentralized model and democratic agenda and prioritize groups like farmers and women, who lack representation under syndicalism.\n\nThe anarchist faction originally allied with the CGT, but as some Syndicalist Bloc factions advocated expanding the Labor Council's powers, anarchists ended their alliance with the Bloc. Moderate syndicalists tried to recruit anarchists, but ultimately, the anarchist alliance joined forces with Cachin's Committee Faction.\n\nThis alliance is more like a coalition of necessity. Due to the political structure of the Commune, two small factions cannot compete with a large, albeit divided, faction. Consequently, the Committee Faction and the Program Faction allied, united against the Syndicalist Bloc’s laissez-faire stance on the CGT's dominance and opposing the authoritarian tendencies of the Jacobin and Sorelian factions."

  frapoc.13.title:0 "Jacobins: Technocrats and Exiles"
  frapoc.13.desc:0 "The coexistence of the Labor Council and the Committee of Public Safety is a result of a compromise between the Jacobin and Syndicalist Blocs. Although the Syndicalists view the Jacobins as 'extreme and dangerous,' the defeat of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Marcel Déat’s Neo-socialist group made the Jacobins impossible for the Commune to ignore. Many bureaucrats support the Jacobin Bloc, or more accurately, the Neo-socialists.\n\nInitially, the Jacobins were more like a parody of their counterparts from the French Revolution, advocating centralized power and repression of opposition. However, with Déat's introduction of Neo-socialism, the Jacobins’ appeal expanded. Neo-socialism aims to establish a socialist technocratic government with a centrally planned economy, supported by many Leninists in France.\n\nAfter Lenin's widow Nadezhda Krupskaya and Bolshevik exiles chose to stay in the French Commune, French Leninists joined forces with the Bolsheviks in the Jacobin Bloc. Beyond their shared vision of a centralized economy, they seek to expand the Committee of Public Safety's powers and curtail the CGT's and the Labor Council's authority."
  frapoc.13.a:0 "The Second French Revolution."
  frapoc.14.title:0 "Sorelian Bloc: Myth and Revolution"
  frapoc.14.desc:0 "The Sorelian Bloc is a unique faction in the Commune’s politics, often composed of war veterans. Compared to other factions, they have a nationalist inclination, or rather, a desire for revenge against the German Empire. Although early Sorélians allied with the Syndicalists, they view the Labor Council as a temporary measure to preserve the revolution. Once the revolutionary flames are kindled, they believe it is time to transfer the Council’s powers to the Committee of Public Safety. For this reason, Sorélians oppose the Labor Council’s expansion and frequently criticize the CGT’s laxity.\n\nWar veterans retain significant influence within the military, with many new Sorelian recruits coming from the Commune’s army, emphasizing honor and revolutionary zeal. The 'Orthodox Sorelian,' or 'Traditionalist' faction led by Georges Valois, opposes the 'Youth Sorelian Vanguard' founded by Georges Bataille, which has rapidly grown, attracting young intellectuals. They interpret Sorelianism differently and are influenced by futurism and vanguardism, with many admiring Leninist André Breton."

In peacetime, this group has grown significantly, with some wealthier workers choosing to become independent business owners. At present, they can no longer be seen as a marginal group.\n\nDespite this, the petty bourgeoisie remains highly divided. Some support a completely free-market economy in line with the anarchist ideology, others favor a technocratic planned economy with the Jacobins, believing they could become technocratic officials, while many young people, influenced by futurism and avant-garde ideas, are drawn to the Sorelists (mainly the "Young Sorel Vanguard" supporters).

This has caused more communes in Brittany to turn to other factions to expand their influence. Of course, Brittany also has powerful local factions, such as the 'Brittany Awakening Movement'. Though not a mainstream faction, the Breton people can still choose them as their representatives in the General Workers’ Council."

  frapoc.906.title:0 "The Shock of Black Monday"
  frapoc.906.desc:0 "The catastrophic collapse of the German stock market triggered a series of economic crises. Waves of workers lost their jobs, and the entire capitalist world seemed to hit the pause button, even rewind. Countless once-famous companies went bankrupt, followed by rising prices and declining public order. Perhaps in the past, those who hadn’t lived through the pre-Civil War years couldn’t understand the evils of capitalism and the necessity of revolution. But now, as the bloody collapse of capitalism brings countless tragedies and disasters before the people, this is a result that no amount of political propaganda could achieve. Though each person may see a different aspect of the crisis, at least they no longer believe in the evil of capitalism."
  frapoc.906.a:0 "Another victory for Syndicalism."
  frapoc.906.b:0 "Look at those poor people."

  frapoc.907.title:0 "Our Small Mistake"
  frapoc.907.desc:0 "Our economic report has already been made public in the main communes. Although our failings pale in comparison to the horrors of Black Monday, such justifications do not convince the people. Due to the long-standing Syndicalist rule, many blame the economic failures on them, even though the representatives handling economic affairs have not always been Syndicalists.\n\nThe Jacobins have attempted to communicate the necessity of a centralized economy. The radical factions within the Syndicalists call for an expanded role for the General Confederation of Labor to establish a more direct syndicalist economic model, while the anarchists argue that the overreach of the Confederation in economic matters is what caused the current economic problems. Meanwhile, the Sorelists believe that it is the Confederation's excessive laxity that has led the Commune's economy into a quagmire."
  frapoc.907.a:0 "The General Confederation of Labor has always been the guarantee for workers."
  frapoc.907.b:0 "The Confederation has replaced the capitalists and become the new tyrant."

  frapoc.908.title:0 "Marseille Turns to the Sorelists"
  frapoc.908.desc:0 "Marseille has always been one of the most important revolutionary bases outside of Paris, but after the Civil War, the divide between Marseille and Paris has grown increasingly apparent, with Marseille largely becoming a stronghold for dissenting voices. Due to its geographical proximity to Italy, the city has attracted intellectuals with ideologies leaning towards Italian futurism and authoritarianism, which have, to a certain extent, shaped the political direction of the city. Some radical workers within the communes have also become followers of the Sorelists, despite the local general union's attempts to weaken the influence of the Sorelists, particularly the Youth Sorelists, with limited success."
  frapoc.908.a:0 "Marseille has always been the vanguard of the revolution."

  frapoc.909.title:0 "Bordeaux Supports Planned Economy"
  frapoc.909.desc:0 "Under the leadership of Adrien Macé, Bordeaux has long been a stronghold for the Neo-socialists. Due to their significant influence, many communes in Bordeaux have undergone a 'Neo-socialist transformation,' and under the guidance of the Jacobins, Bordeaux, a region once focused on light industry and agriculture, has undergone rapid industrialization. Shipbuilding remains the primary manufacturing sector, but what is most surprising is the establishment of chemical plants and agricultural machinery factories. Thanks to its proximity to central agricultural areas, Bordeaux's agricultural industry has become highly developed, though this has led to some minor environmental issues."
  frapoc.909.a:0 "This is the work of the Neo-socialists."
  frapoc.909.b:0 "This further proves the superiority of the planned economy."

  frapoc.910.title:0 "British Comrades Visit Calais"
  frapoc.910.desc:0 "Recently, a delegation of British comrades visited Calais, an action that raises suspicions of British interference in the upcoming General Workers’ Council elections. This, however, has greatly benefited the anarchist factions. Calais has always been a stronghold for anarchists, and with the British comrades participating in local campaign speeches, most communes in Calais have shifted towards anarchism. They seek to escape the excessive control of the General Confederation of Labor and use the strategic position of the Calais Strait to trade with other countries, or perhaps even with merchants from the Imperial Pact, to further develop Calais' economy."
  frapoc.910.a:0 "Cheers to our British comrades."

  frapoc.911.title:0 "General Confederation of Labor Meeting in Paris"
  frapoc.911.desc:0 "Paris, the capital of the Republic, the brightest city in Europe, and the birthplace of the revolution, is home to countless ideas and strategies. Various brilliant minds have gathered here, all eager to witness the prosperity of Paris. Since the victory of the revolution in 1919, Paris has been the freest, most prosperous, and most open haven for syndicalism. The leader of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) has always been in Paris, and the radical syndicalist leader, Monatte, currently the chairman of the General Workers’ Council, held a speech at the Revolutionary Square of Paris, surrounded by key radical figures. Though a few moderate members can be seen in the crowd, the event is clearly dominated by the syndicalist faction.\n\nThe speech was as expected, with radicals pushing for the further expansion of the CGT's power to directly protect workers' rights. This is the reason why anarchists remain independent, but it is also the reason why authoritarian groups are displeased. Many of the workers in Paris are the children of revolutionaries, who take great pride in their parents' involvement in the great revolution. Perhaps, it is now the time for these new generations to further the revolution."
  frapoc.911.a:0 "Without the General Confederation of Labor, there would be no Commune."
  frapoc.911.b:0 "Each generation has its own revolution."

  frapoc.912.title:0 "Dissent in the Crowd"
  frapoc.912.desc:0 "Paris is not just the Paris of Parisians. In many ways, Paris has become synonymous with France itself. Despite regional differences leading to various stereotypes, most French people take pride in Paris, and the city is home to compatriots from all over the country. In the end, Paris is not a closed city; it is open and inclusive, which is one of the reasons it has become such a great city.\n\nHowever, this openness has its consequences. Dissenters have emerged. Perhaps, under the former authoritarian monarchy and the hypocritical bourgeois democracy, the people were forced into silence. But now, why should they not express their opinions? After all, the French Commune is a nation of the people, and freedom of speech has always been a fundamental right. Perhaps, the arrogant leaders will regret this, but the truth is, the people have learned to think for themselves. Or perhaps, they have converted to something else..."
  frapoc.912.a:0 "Farmers are part of the people too!"
  frapoc.912.b:0 "The development of productivity will bring true liberation!"
  frapoc.912.c:0 "Our compatriots are still under the oppression of Germany!"

  frapoc.913.title:0 "Monatte's Response"
  frapoc.913.desc:0 "This sudden opposition caused the entire meeting to descend into chaos. The radical syndicalist supporters tried to find the source of the dissent, as it was their meeting, but the disorganized crowd was like shifting sand dunes—once one was overcome, another identical one appeared. The most awkward moment came for Monatte on stage, who did not expect such an overt opposition at a syndicalist gathering. His prepared speech was now irrelevant, and continuing would risk losing the support of the crowd. Faced with this situation, Monatte had no choice but to address the opposition, or else...\n\nMonatte barely managed to restore some order to the meeting, but the crowd remained restless, waiting for him to respond. Everyone expected Monatte to react as they wished—calmly address the issue, cleverly rebut it, or awkwardly avoid it."
  frapoc.913.a:0 "Of course, farmers are our comrades and brothers."
  frapoc.913.b:0 "The liberation of workers will naturally lead to an increase in productivity."
  frapoc.913.c:0 "France will regain her glory under the unity of the General Confederation of Labor."
  frapoc.913.d:0 "This issue is not within the scope of our discussion..."

  frapoc.914.title:0 "Chaotic Meeting"
  frapoc.914.desc:0 "Monatte's words clearly did not satisfy the meeting participants. Before Monatte had finished speaking, murmurs of disagreement began, quickly spreading to the entire gathering. This was a public meeting, and the crowd was diverse—ranging from staunch syndicalist supporters to Neo-socialists, and even to disillusioned alcoholics simply opposing the government.\n\nWe do not know who started the brawl, but its consequences were disastrous. The chaotic crowd quickly turned into a fight, and Monatte and his radical allies could only watch helplessly from the stage. They tried to call for the security force, but since the defense powers were decentralized to the people, even the defense force members were caught in the struggle. The police, called in from outside the meeting, had no way of handling such a chaotic gathering, and since the syndicalists had demanded unarmed police, there were even instances of defense force members being knocked down by civilians.\n\nClearly, if this chaos continues unchecked, it will lead to greater disaster. But Monatte faces a dilemma: to address the current situation, force will be necessary. They are idealists, but not out of touch with reality. However, if the defense force cannot handle it, the only option left is to call in the commune army, but doing so would surely spark more unrest."

  frapoc.915.title:0 "The Commune Debates"
  frapoc.915.desc:0 "The Commune Debates began spontaneously in the 1920s as a forum for discussion, but over several years, this format has evolved into an established, unregulated tradition. Typically, supporters from different factions gather to debate specific issues without strict rules, usually speaking informally back and forth. The venues are also quite casual, often held in local salons, though as their influence has grown, many Commune Debates now choose more public locations to attract larger audiences.\n\nThe syndicalists, who were frustrated at the recent rally, desperately need this opportunity to recover from the negative impact of that event and, if possible, to win additional support. Other factions also wish to present their views on specific issues at this debate, especially as democratically elected leaders are typically syndicalists. Given the current situation, with divisions among the syndicalists and conflicts with other factions, this debate may further shift the direction of Commune politics. At this critical juncture, perhaps we should discuss..."

  frapoc.915.c:0 "...relations with Germany."

  frapoc.9151.title:0 "On the Issue of Women's Rights"
  frapoc.9151.desc:0 "Feminists have long been allies of socialists, but unfortunately, many male socialists still see women as weaker, subordinate, or controllable. However, women played essential roles in the revolution, and without their support, it is doubtful that the revolution could have succeeded. Now that we have established a syndicalist state and legally recognized women's rights and duties, there is still much left to do in the eyes of feminists.\n\nNo matter how much effort we’ve put into women’s issues, the topic of women's rights is increasingly becoming a focus within the Commune, and there's no better place to discuss it than at the debate. After all, this issue shouldn't alienate too many people, except perhaps conservatives—and there shouldn’t be too many of them, right?\n\nThe Anarchists are the first to express their views, as they have always been unofficial allies of the feminists. If the syndicalists don’t bring something equally compelling to the table, the audience won’t be impressed."
  frapoc.9151.a:0 "Women will play a larger role in governance."

  frapoc.91511.title:0 "Conservative Bureaucrats Oppose Women in Politics"
  frapoc.91511.desc:0 "Following the Commune debate, bureaucrats showed open discontent with the syndicalists' statements, particularly questioning women's capacity to participate in politics. They argue that from labor intensity to bureaucratic efficiency, women struggle to fulfill these roles. Bureaucrats view giving certain administrative positions to women merely to display gender equality as superficial politicking, unlikely to truly benefit the Commune’s development. Should we reconsider our policies?"
  frapoc.91511.a:0 "Politics is a gentleman's game."
  frapoc.91511.b:0 "But ladies deserve their place."

  frapoc.91512.title:0 "Officers Oppose Women in the Military"
  frapoc.91512.desc:0 "After the Commune debate, the officers’ corps quickly expressed their strong opposition, particularly toward women joining the military. Their stance is rooted in traditional gender roles: women should serve the home front, care for families, and wait for their husbands or sons to return victorious, not charge into battle. Many view women in combat as a sign of national decline, arguing that if even women and children are needed on the front lines, it reflects government and military failures.\n\nThey question: if women go to the front, who will care for our children? Who will bake sweet treats for the soldiers? More importantly, our army isn't yet desperate enough to need women in combat—we still have young men ready to fight. If these young men won’t sacrifice for the women, but instead let the women sacrifice for them, they’ll bring shame upon themselves and the nation."
  frapoc.91512.a:0 "War is too dangerous for ladies."
  frapoc.91512.b:0 "The women of the Commune are not Maries but Joans."

  frapoc.9152.title:0 "On the Issue of Colonial Liberation"
  frapoc.9152.desc:0 "Capitalism was born in Europe, built on the blood and sweat of countless colonies. Gold, spices, and exotic treasures flowed continuously to Europe, which became like a mythical dragon hoarding riches. Since the Enlightenment, colonial peoples have been awakening and resisting their oppressors. Our uprising drove the bourgeois France to flee to Algeria and forced the once-mighty British Empire to retreat to the far north.\n\nHowever, colonial peoples remain unliberated. The German Empire has replaced Britain and France as the world's sole colonial power, and reactionaries in Algeria cling to the lands of Northwest Africa. The Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia still suffer under harsh colonial regimes where justice is absent, leaving only laboring masses and stolen resources.\n\nWe certainly have a responsibility to support global colonial liberation movements. In past decades, our limited strength prevented us from effectively aiding our distant comrades. But now, do we have the capacity to influence colonial situations? If so, how should we concretely assist these oppressed people?"
  frapoc.9152.a:0 "We will aid colonial resistance fighters."
  frapoc.9152.b:0 "We will directly incite the colonial people."

  frapoc.91521.title:0 "Echoes in Germany"
  frapoc.91521.desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis in Germany is undoubtedly an opportunity, especially as it plunges Germany’s puppet states into economic turmoil, spreading discontent. For our colonial liberation cause, this is an excellent chance. German colonies in Central Africa and East Asia will be bogged down by the catastrophe Germany unleashed, and all we need to do is give them a little push.\n\nHowever, while we should assist the oppressed people in the colonies, we cannot intervene everywhere. We should focus on certain areas to ensure meaningful progress without overextending ourselves."
  frapoc.91521.a:0 "We should focus on Africa."
  frapoc.91521.b:0 "We should focus on Asia."
  frapoc.91521.c:0 "Shouldn’t we help them all?"

  frapoc.91522.title:0 "Protests from the Internationalists"
  frapoc.91522.desc:0 "As a nation whose international policy is rooted in internationalism, we have consistently promoted this stance domestically as well. Though building up strength to counter colonial powers is a sound strategy, our people see this as a sign of weakness and deceit. Following our debate, some internationalists, including interventionists, took to the streets, demanding that the Commune engage more actively in global affairs."
  frapoc.91522.a:0 "Weakening colonies is also weakening empires."
  frapoc.91522.b:0 "Public opinion may not always be correct."

  frapoc.9153.title:0 "On Relations with Germany"
  frapoc.9153.desc:0 "The German Empire, as our neighbor and the world's dominant power, has always been the highest priority for Commune foreign policy. While our relations with Germany are not terrible at present, it is foreseeable that there will be a clash between us and the German reactionaries. After over a decade of Commune development, our people no longer wish just to defend the revolution—they want to engage in global affairs. And to do so, relations with Germany cannot be avoided.\n\nThe Sorelian faction is the most hardline, driven by revolutionary fervor and a spirit of vengeance from the World War. They are likely to pull us into the quagmire of war with Germany. Currently, syndicalists aim to avoid war by inciting socialist and syndicalist forces within Germany, hoping to dismantle the German Empire from within. Although the Anarchists and Jacobins generally agree with this approach, they differ greatly on which factions to support and how to do so."

  frapoc.91531.title:0 "Marseille Bar Riot"
  frapoc.91531.desc:0 "Marseille has long been a city of immigrants, but this hasn't stopped it from becoming one of the most nationalistic places in France. Following the Commune debate, the Sorélians in Marseille grew increasingly brazen, often harassing those unsupportive of the Sorélians, especially non-French individuals. The local defense force, composed largely of Sorélians, turned a blind eye.\n\nDue to these issues, immigrants often relocate to Toulon or Nice. Despite this, a sizeable immigrant population remains in Marseille. Though compared to Paris and the Franco-German border, the German community in Marseille is dwindling, a small German population persists. On one ordinary day, a group of drunken workers caused trouble in a German-owned bar, unleashing nationalist hostility and vandalizing the establishment. While the guard later arrested the drunken rioters, this incident has undoubtedly harmed our political image."

Meanwhile, anti-French factions within the German Empire are exploiting the incident, depicting it as an atrocity by syndicalists and the French nation. If we continue to escalate, the already tense Franco-German relations may worsen."

  frapoc.21.desc:0 "Whereas the French Republic had pushed Parisian French to apply across the whole territory, bringing regional languages to the brink of extinction, the federal form of our model gave the communes the power to manage language.\n\nHowever, some communes began to use only their regional language for all administrative work, and even in their representation at the Bourse Générale du Travail, without really trying to ensure that other delegates could understand them. The totalist bloc strongly criticized these practices as counter-revolutionary or anti-French, while anarchists militated for federal recognition of the various regional languages."

  frapoc.22.desc:0 "France had some 36,000 communes of all different sizes, from those with several thousand inhabitants to small hamlets inhabited by fewer than 5 people. Our constitution gave them all quasi-independence, but their excessive disparity made the allocation of resources counter-productive and the number of delegates unmanageable. Comrade Sorel proposed that the smallest communes be merged together to reach sizes deemed respectable, while the anarchists saw in this fragmentation the reasons for a more decentralized republic. The syndicalists were content to propose the mutualization of unions and local exchanges."

  frapoc.23.desc:0 "France has an intimate history with its capital, Paris. However, while the rural exodus has led many fellow workers to move to the big cities, especially Paris, rural areas are much less populated. This is reflected in proportional representation at the Bourse Générale du Travail, where Parisian delegates account for such a dominant share that some federated Communes protest at what they call a confiscation of socialist democracy. The syndicalists described the march of progress as unstoppable, but were not against a minimum and maximum number of delegates, while the totalists argued that Paris is the heart of the Nation and should have its rightful place. The anarchist delegates, mostly from rural areas, called for the hegemony of Paris to be abolished by giving more power to the regions."

The army and totalitarian movements saw this as proof of greater centralization. The government and the General Labor Exchange quickly drafted a law to clarify federal military powers, under criticism from anarchist representatives who saw in it a hidden beginning of centralization of coercive forces."

However, this can lead to questionable moral drift, as when one commune in the north legalized adulterous marriage, or another with a strong nudist movement passed a law requiring visitors to disrobe on entering the commune. These practices have shocked the rest of the country. Totalists see this as the drift of too much freedom, and demand moral laws. Syndicalists are deeply divided on the issue, between the most libertarian and the most statist. Finally, the anarchists, though critical of too much immorality, would prefer to create a new level between the commune and the region to moderate this kind of decision."

  frapoc.98.title:0 "CGT Situation" 
  frapoc.98.desc:0 "We must acknowledge that the CGT played a very important role during the revolution, but after the victory, it expanded even faster than before. Countless small unions, either voluntarily or involuntarily, merged with the now-glorious CGT. Some more independent local unions may have maintained their autonomy, but under the glory of the revolution’s victory, the CGT shone too brightly. It is understandable that those scattered revolutionary unions, seeking a place in the new political system, joined the CGT.\n\nThe syndicalists (before the anarchists broke away) led the CGT, and to a large extent, the CGT has already replaced the government. Although the Labour Congress still exists, all key decisions come from the seats occupied by the CGT. The commune's laws do not stipulate how many seats each union should hold in the Labour Congress, leading to the consequence that joining smaller independent unions effectively removes one’s voting rights. Almost no one, even those who later opposed the CGT, realized that no article specifically outlined the ambiguous relationship between the CGT and the Labour Congress. 'The CGT is the Labour Congress' has almost become an unacknowledged 'fact-law'.\n\nThe change began with a labor dispute: The CGT is not just a political representative organization for workers, but also a powerful body capable of making decisions about factory production. When a famous anarchist lawyer tried to sue the CGT on behalf of a worker who was not a member of the CGT, he despairingly found that he had no chance of winning, simply because his client was not a member of the CGT. This incident ignited a fierce debate about the CGT, and the anarchists eventually split from the syndicalists."
  frapoc.98.a:0 "I hope this is not a fable."

  frapoc.26.title:0 "Cultural question"
  frapoc.26.desc:0 "Socialist movements are particularly interested in the cultural issue. The idea, more than to give everyone access to it, is to create a new culture outside the one of the bourgeois. The old culture must be abolished, and the past must be thrown out in order to create the socialist man and socialist model. However, French cultural capital is rich and does not necessarily come from bourgeois domination. What to do with the medium-aged castles or the traditional baguette? If syndicalists are in favor of a radical transformation of culture, Jacobins recall that the French Revolution had socialist aspects and that French culture is linked to socialism. The anarchists are content to push for a valorization and protection of the crops of the lands."
  frapoc.26.a:0 "A clean state from the past!"
  frapoc.26.b:0 "French culture is socialist culture."
  frapoc.26.c:0 "Protect out lands’ culture."

  frapoc.311.desc:0 "At the beginning of the reform, we should appropriately choose a direction as our short-term goal, to guide our bureaucratic system and show them our determination for reform, rather than making a show of it. On the contrary, we have made our attitude clear: only a technocratic government can help us escape from meaningless moral political struggles and direct all our energy towards development.\n\nThe training of technocrats is an extremely important link, as it directly determines the quality of our technocrats. They should be well-educated engineers with a high level of expertise in science and technology. However, some people in our faction argue that in addition to academic qualifications, the political education of technocrats should also be emphasized. After all, politics is the art of dealing with people, and a mute genius can hardly lead others forward. But the most frequently mentioned opinion is that technocrats should start from the grassroots level. Without practical experience, theory is useless.\n\nUndoubtedly, there are reasons for all these opinions, but we cannot cater to all of them. In the end, we can only choose a more biased policy."
  frapoc.311.a:0 "Technocrats must possess 'technology'."
  frapoc.311.b:0 "Technocrats must first be bureaucrats."
  frapoc.311.c:0 "Technocrats cannot be without a foundation."
  frapoc.312.title:0 "Reform direction: Appointment system"
  frapoc.312.desc:0 "Once we have solved the training system for technocrats, if we do not have a corresponding appointment system, we still cannot claim to have technocrats. Since this society involves a division of labor, everyone clearly has a position that suits them. If we let someone who excels in managing the economy manage personnel, and someone who is better at managing personnel handle the economy, it’s no surprise that our economy and personnel management will face problems.\n\nOf course, reforming the appointment system is difficult. Before the revolution, we mainly used the appointment system, which was more of a 'nepotism system' than anything else, with incompetent people filling positions thanks to personal connections. After the revolution, we now have democratic elections, which reduce corruption to some extent, but the problem is that people tend to choose those with good oratory skills and charm, rather than those who are truly capable but remain unnoticed.\n\nTherefore, we must make a new change. The most popular reform proposal at the moment is to establish a review committee composed of technocrats for personnel appointments. Some believe this plan carries the risk of corruption, and a system should be established with clear guidelines for personnel promotion. Others wish to maintain the current democratic election method but have the technocratic reform committee nominate candidates. After all, being eloquent does not necessarily mean lacking ability, and if we can find officials who are both capable and charismatic, everyone will be happy."
  frapoc.312.a:0 "Let the technocrat committee manage everything."
  frapoc.312.b:0 "The technocrat committee should follow a clear promotion guideline."
  frapoc.312.c:0 "It’s enough for the technocrat committee to nominate candidates."
  frapoc.313.title:0 "Reform direction: Accountability system"
  frapoc.313.desc:0 "With a training system and an appointment system, we might be able to establish a technocratic government, but this is still merely a technocratic management government. What we pursue is a socialist technocratic government. If our technocrats do not care about the people's voice, they lose the essence of socialism. Undoubtedly, the evil and corrupt bureaucratic image in the past largely came from the lack of an accountability system. Now, our socialist technocratic government should make it clear to the people that our government is still the servant of the people, and the government’s interests are inherently the interests of the people. If progress and development cannot benefit the people, what kind of progress and development is that? What is the difference from capitalism?\n\nDesigning an accountability system must be done with caution, because the people do not necessarily know what they want. They are easily misled by information, and capitalist countries have long used this to deceive their people. Therefore, we might design a questionnaire for the people to answer questions within a framework we create. This method is more efficient and will allow us to pinpoint the key issues, rather than relying on the people's enthusiasm to give us feedback. After all, when the people start providing feedback, it means we have failed. Some opponents argue that technocrats should be closer to the people, and that regular work reports can help exchange opinions in real time. Others believe this wastes the technocrats' time, and that they should only make their work results public. If anyone has issues, they will come forward. Besides, technocrats are already required to report their work to superiors, so this method is more convenient."
  frapoc.313.a:0 "Surveys allow more people to provide feedback."
  frapoc.313.b:0 "Regular work reports can strengthen the relationship between technocrats and the people."
  frapoc.313.c:0 "Publishing work results achieves the same effect, and technocrats can focus more on their work."

  FRA_jaco_leni_goals_key:0 "The Leninist faction is a secret society that developed in mainland France, following Vladimir Lenin's vanguardist ideas. After the failure of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, Lenin's widow, along with several Bolshevik generals, fled to France and officially formed the 'French Popular Communist Party' after the French Revolution. Although, due to political considerations, the Leninists had to form an alliance with the Jacobins, in reality, they remained relatively independent. Apart from cooperation in planned economy policies, they do not share much common ground with the new socialists. In summary, the Leninist faction believes that syndicalism will lead the country to failure, especially as the nation faces the risk of a bourgeois restoration. Reforms that do not completely eradicate capitalism, particularly capitalist cultural ideologies, will not be enough. The vanguard will play this role, aiming to completely remove capitalism from French soil.\n\n§oVanguard Status§!:\n§oControl Level§!：[lenin_party_control_level]\n§oInternal Purity§!：[lenin_party_pure_level]\n§oMasses Approval§!：[lenin_party_masses_level]\n\n§9Bureaucratic Orientation Plan§!:\n§4Bureaucratic Bias§!:\n[?lenin_to_leninism|Y.1%%] of the §4bureaucrats§! are biased towards §xVanguardism§!\n[?lenin_to_neosocialism|Y.1%%] of the §4bureaucrats§! are biased towards §gTechnocracy§!\n\n§9Bureaucratic Resistance§!：[?lenin_admin_anti|R.1]"

  frapoc.420.title:0 "Faction Rivalry"
  frapoc.420.desc:0 "The Youth Sorelian faction is divided into several factions, each with its unique ideology. While there are no restrictions on joining multiple factions, individuals often dedicate themselves to one faction, with few participating in more than three. Despite nominal equality among factions, the varying number of members inevitably makes some factions more prominent. Even if we secure the government position, it is impossible to involve all factions in governance. A compromise has led to a strategy of joint governance among the four largest factions. However, the dominant faction will inevitably exert more influence, shaping policy with its ideology.\n\nThe Futurism faction is the largest and most publicly recognized faction within the Youth Sorelians. They are most interested in scientific inventions and industrial technology, envisioning a France transformed into a hub of science and technology under their leadership.\n\nThe Mysticism faction, slightly smaller, leans towards deriving knowledge from religion. While mysticism may appear foolish to many atheistic French citizens, it is far from simple superstition. Their philosophy is intricate and obscure. Surprisingly, this faction comprises mostly young soldiers and officers rather than scholars or covert believers.\n\nSurrealism, originating from French soil, focuses on humanity rather than technology, emphasizing abstract, collective humanity over isolated individuals. They believe modern productivity has transformed the world, but humanity itself has stagnated. Humanity must adapt to industrialization through self-reformation, both mentally and physically. External aids, rather than genetic changes, are viewed as the best tools for human evolution.\n\nUltramaterialism, introduced by Benjamin, is a philosophy rooted in German ideology that has spread across France despite tense Franco-German relations. Today, the Ultramaterialism faction stands as an equal partner among the top four factions in the Youth Sorelian leadership."

  frapoc.421.desc:0 "His arms held immense power and moved freely, his legs tireless. Upon his shoulders grew a hundred serpent heads, each a fearsome dragon, with black tongues darting and fire gleaming beneath the remarkable brows of his head. When he glared fiercely, flames danced atop his brow. His dreadful heads emitted a cacophony of indescribable sounds: the earth trembled, the vast heavens above, the seas, and the streams of the great oceans all resounded. Mighty Olympus shook beneath his profane feet, and the earth groaned in response.\n\nWaves of heat swept the deep blue sea, accompanied by thunder and lightning, furious flames, scorching winds, and blinding thunderbolts. The entire earth, sky, and sea boiled. Under his assault, the mighty waves ravaged the shores, and endless tremors ensued. Hades quaked in his realm of the dead, and the Titans, dwelling with Cronos in the depths of Tartarus, trembled in endless uproar and fearful conflict.\n\nThen flames burst forth from the thunderbolt, scorching the vast regions of the earth with its shadowed, jagged ravines. A considerable portion of the great earth was consumed by dreadful vapors, melting away as tin melts when heated in crucibles by the art of humans; or as iron, the hardest of all substances, is scorched by glowing flames in mountain valleys. Under his strength, sacred ground melted away.\n\nAnd in that moment, the earth melted into rivers under the radiance of the blazing fire. By day, rivers of smoke surged, and by night, deep red flames set rocks ablaze, sending them crashing thunderously into the depths of the sea plain. He spewed the most fearsome of flames; it was a wondrous sight to behold and an awe-inspiring sound to hear when present."

But the grave belongs to the old; the young blood flows within youthful bodies. Humanity was born wingless; why fear losing what it never had? Fear prevents advancement; dread hinders exploration; the unknown defies belief in the knowable.\n\nThus, they are destined for obsolescence, destined to be forgotten, destined to age and die, to rot into the earth, to rejoice briefly in fleeting ascents, and to impose their shackles upon their offspring. Arrogant and ignorant, they are beyond reason.\n\nBehold, the winds carry their message, tinged with the scent of decay. Flap your wings and summon the gentle breeze to scatter that stench into the dust, transforming it into remnants—the bones of the elderly, paving the way forward. Stride boldly ahead, for there lies no fear. Should zombies or skeletons clutch at your ankles, flap your wings. Flap your wings! Flap the wings that are yours alone!\n\nThe sun is not the endpoint.

  frapoc.423.desc:0 "The messenger of the gods walked among mortals. He saw a farmer, not working, sowing, weaving, or herding. Emaciated, his bones poked through his skin, his eyes hollow, arms drooping, knees in the cracked soil, hips touching barren earth. There were no wife, children, house, or fields in sight—only a single strong horse, a cart, and a well-fed servant. So the messenger asked, 'What has happened to you, turning you into this state, and why has this official come to see you?' The farmer said nothing, only bowing his head into the soil as if begging. Before he could react, the official consumed the farmer entirely, not even leaving dust behind. A demon? No, just a man.\n\nThe messenger of the gods walked among mortals. He saw another farmer. This one was robust and ruddy-faced. Upon seeing him, the farmer approached and said, 'You must be the messenger. I have a letter to send to the past.' The messenger frowned, 'I am the messenger of the gods. How could I be ordered around by mortals?' The farmer replied, 'Under this azure sky, where can gods be seen? They are just lofty claims of those who plunder the people in their name. If gods truly existed, why do they not protect the people instead of aiding the tyrants? We rebels naturally reject the gods. If gods truly exist, why do they not protect tyrants when we overthrow them? And if gods stand in the way of our pursuit of happiness, then we shall slay the gods as well!'\n\nHe was speechless and could only ask, 'You said you had a letter to send to the past. I can deliver it. But I have one condition: tell me what is written on it.' The farmer laughed. It bore only four words:"

  frapoc.424.desc:0 "If humans are created in the image of the gods, then why are there so many ugly, corrupt, ignorant, and violent individuals? Gods have flaws, so humans have flaws. Gods have hierarchies and ranks, so humans have poverty and wealth. Yet gods possess great power, while humans do not.\n\nWhere is the line between humans and gods? It lies only in power: one possesses it, and the other does not. But when humans acquire that power, how do they differ from gods? The gods’ power is innate, therefore they use it thoughtlessly, much like a lion does not train itself. Gods do not strive for anything. Humans, however, lack innate power. Thus, they constantly innovate, seek greater power, and even aspire to the power of creation.\n\nIsis's children are human, not divine. But Isis is a goddess. When her children no longer need her, what must she feel? So, she asked the humans why her children must leave her. Their answer was simple: children must grow up, leave their mother's embrace, and become parents themselves. Gods do not age and therefore lack progress. Humans age and die, so they strive onward. Thus, humanity ultimately surpasses the gods. Not the success of an individual, but the success of an entire species."

This is not due to personal grudges, but because they are not fit for these roles.

The government of New Socialism, made up of technocrats, perfectly combines the needs of the people with the needs of the state. It is so rational and powerful that no bourgeois regime can compare, and the previous Syndicalist model has proven less successful than our streamlined and effective technocratic government. We have already stepped into glorious progress!"
  FRA_gratify_jaco_leni_desc:0 "Bolshevism is not a ghost wandering on the battlefields of Russia; it is real, and it exists right here in France. Leninism may have failed in Russia, but we say 'Revolution is dead, long live the Revolution!' It is precisely because Leninism failed in Russia that we now have the opportunity to practice Leninism in France. Those who criticize Leninism often argue that we lack democracy, but when the people elect Leninists to power, what do they have to say then?"
  FRA_jaco_leni_ideology_desc:0 "Ideological unity is the most important issue. If we do not ensure the unity of thought within our group, the risk of bourgeois restoration will not be fully avoided, and our people will be ruled by a so-called socialist bourgeois regime. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. We must extinguish the flames of bourgeois restoration and give every person the fire extinguisher known as 'proletarian consciousness.' Only in this way can we build true socialism."
  FRA_jaco_leni_ideology_pure_desc:0 "Merely extinguishing the flames of bourgeois restoration is not enough. Even among comrades on the same path, some may unknowingly be revisionists. They mistakenly believe their methods are correct, but in reality, their methods are nothing more than disguised capitalist approaches, which will ultimately lead to bourgeois restoration. What we need to do is help our comrades recognize their errors and guide them onto the right path."
  FRA_jaco_leni_total_change_desc:0 "Revolution is the overthrow of one class by another, the resistance of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Our revolution overthrew the bourgeois republic government, but it was difficult to eliminate the bourgeois cultural heritage that remained. These remnants constantly corrupt our revolutionary ranks. However, now the Leninists have removed the bourgeois weeds, and the fire of revolution has burned away the rotten wood of capitalism."

  FRA_sore_won_first_election_desc:0 "The echoes of Sorelism still resonate in the hearts of the people of the French Commune. True 'revolutionary syndicalism' has never dissipated. A satisfactory social order cannot emerge spontaneously; it must arise through revolutionary action. Sorel's prophecy has proven increasingly valuable after the revolution. Those syndicalists who claimed to bring about a true revolution have proven time and again that they have long forgotten their original purpose. Now, the people have reawakened to their true intentions, and Sorelism will once again dominate the Commune."
  FRA_gratify_sore_oldl_desc:0 "Sorelism emphasizes the proletariat, emphasizing the unity of workers as a collective group. Many well-meaning people mistakenly associate this connection with nationalism, but true Sorelists would tell them that even though nationalism is a constructed concept, that doesn't mean it is false. The proletariat may be divided due to their differences, but when facing the bourgeoisie, they unite as one. This is why conservatives try to invoke this ancient consciousness—nationalism, born out of struggle and revolution."

The Public Safety Committee established by the Jacobins was farsighted. Although we disagree with them on certain points, we sincerely appreciate their insight. Revolution must be explosive, and revolutions that stretch over several years are not revolutions. Once revolution becomes reform, the parasites have time to erode. Expanding the powers of the Public Safety Committee will be the antidote to kill the parasites."
  FRA_election_sore_totalist_revolution_desc:0 "Those who envy totalitarianism describe it as a terrifying and authoritarian ideology, even claiming that under totalitarianism, the people will lose democracy and freedom. They are half right: under totalitarianism, the people lose fake, manipulated democracy by vote, and gain real, spontaneous, and active democracy; the people lose the freedom to be self-destructive and corrupt, and gain the freedom to think and act boldly, without fear of the weak. The enemies of totalitarianism fear us because they know it will bring real liberation. When that happens, there will be no place for the deceivers!"

Those wolves and tigers will not bow their heads, and our proletariat brothers must declare war on them: war on the bourgeoisie, war on the landlords, war on the monarchs, war on the popes, war on everything that oppresses and exploits the people! War will bring revolution, and revolution will allow the people to rise to the stage that rightfully belongs to them. We must constantly create this revolutionary atmosphere, or we will fail to cleanse the harmful effects that have plagued our people."

It is time for us to reconsider these issues."

If they aren't willing to protect their rights, then who else can help them? The CGT is compassionate and generous, it has always protected the rights of the majority of workers. Therefore, the issue with the CGT is not that its powers are too large, but that its coverage is insufficient. As long as workers join the CGT, such tragedies will not happen."
  FRA_cgt_reform_strengthen_must_join_desc:0 "Although the CGT has been calling for people to join, many still refuse to defend their own and other workers' rights and stay out of the matter. But when their rights are harmed, they blame the CGT for inaction and indifference. Well, since some are unwilling to defend their own rights, we should make it mandatory for people to join. Through participating in union matters, they will understand why the CGT is right and how wrong they were before."
  FRA_cgt_reform_strengthen_expand_range_desc:0 "The CGT should not just serve as a communication organization. Some CGT branches are already managing factory organization and production, showing advantages over the previous model. We should give this power to the CGT. Not only production, but the CGT should also be responsible for providing leisure and health maintenance for workers. This can deepen the brotherhood among the proletariat and also alleviate the increasingly tense public resource distribution."
  FRA_cgt_reform_strengthen_rank_leader_desc:0 "The CGT's hierarchy is a non-discriminatory system, aimed at encouraging people to participate in CGT work. Through achieving volunteer ranks, members can enjoy more benefits or receive rewards. Of course, this can also be an honor, an honor based on the people. We estimate that this measure will increase people's enthusiasm and accelerate the integration of newcomers into the CGT."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_desc:0 "Before the revolution, the CGT was always a friend of the working class, but after the revolution, the shortcomings of the CGT have become more and more apparent, with growing protests against the CGT—coming from the working class itself. Every organization goes through a growth and corruption phase, and now the CGT has entered its stage of decay. We have no reason not to respond to the people's wishes. Since the people are dissatisfied with the CGT, we should reform it."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_common_desc:0 "In any case, the CGT still plays a crucial role in our society's production and daily life. Recklessly destroying a pillar of society will inevitably bring chaos. Moreover, the CGT has merely overstepped its bounds without causing overly harmful effects. What we need to do is put the CGT's power back in a cage, returning it to a normal union organization."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_common_normalization_desc:0 "The relationship between the Syndicalists and the CGT is self-evident. They have always tried to turn the CGT into a breeding ground for Syndicalist supporters, and in fact, they have nearly succeeded. Such a politically charged organization inevitably drags its members into the fray and even generates hostility towards workers outside the CGT with different ideologies. This undoubtedly goes against the original purpose of the union. We need to make the CGT return to being a purely labor intermediary organization, not a political clique."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_common_diversty_desc:0 "For workers already defeated by propaganda, we cannot force them to change their opinions. What we can do is allow more dissenters in the CGT, which can dilute the strong political atmosphere.

Focusing on the present will help people realize how wrong their past behavior was."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_radi_desc:0 "The CGT has proven it is no longer suitable for the current revolutionary form. It increasingly shows tendencies to hinder social fairness and justice. Undoubtedly, the kind-hearted people have reached the point of intolerability, and if that is the case, we should thoroughly reform the CGT to make it more in line with the interests of the state and the people."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_radi_reshuffle_desc:0 "It is not just the CGT. Other union organizations also have similar problems. Even if we solve the CGT issue, how can we be sure there won't be another CGT? The best approach is to completely restructure our union organizations and establish a union system that reflects reality. Only then can we solve such problems once and for all."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_radi_control_desc:0 "Unions are essentially organizations for negotiation between labor and management. However, in capitalist countries, due to the ruthlessness of capitalists, this negotiation often develops into conflict and even revolution. But now we are a socialist country, and the previous union organization model no longer fits the current production relations. The wisest approach is to create a union platform under state management, where the state can adjudicate labor disputes, making it not only more transparent but also fairer."
  FRA_cgt_reform_release_radi_abolished_desc:0 "Although our education has improved, it is unrealistic to expect all workers to be familiar with legal texts. This is why corporate systems will be more efficient than union systems. If workers' demands are for more rights, they should express them in political arenas. But if their demand is for the protection of their legal rights, union organizations become cumbersome, as such individual demands do not require such a large body. Since these are legal rights, they should be resolved legally. And since legal solutions are necessary, corporations are undoubtedly more professional and efficient than unions."

  FRA_women_right_start_reform_desc:0 "Since the establishment of the French Commune, we have been pushing for fundamental social changes, but there is one area that has yet to fully realize true revolutionary equality — the status of women. In the capitalist world, women have always been oppressed and exploited, relegated to the role of dependents in the family, marginalized in society, and even regarded as mere appendages to the productive forces. Now, as a truly socialist country, we must completely transform this structure, ensuring that women can fully participate in social construction and enjoy equal rights and opportunities with men. From labor to politics, from family to the military, women should not merely exist as auxiliary roles but should be builders of the socialist future, possessing equal status and power."
  FRA_women_right_conservative_desc:0 "In some areas, the pace of reform has already advanced far enough. Women's roles in society are gradually being recognized, and women are beginning to demonstrate their potential. For many conservatives, the current situation seems good enough, and they believe no further intervention is needed."
  FRA_women_right_radical_desc:0 "In every aspect of national construction, women should enjoy the same opportunities and rights as men. To this end, we will implement comprehensive women's rights reforms. This is not only about demanding equal job opportunities but also about building a comprehensive social security system, covering aspects such as wages, working hours, and career development. We will ensure that women can play a role in all industries and receive equal treatment with men. We need to encourage women to step out of the home, into society, and participate in the forefront of national construction."
  FRA_women_right_radical_military_desc:0 "As part of the proletariat, women should also bear the responsibility of defending the homeland in the socialist army. In fact, whether on the front lines or in logistics support, women have shown strength and combat effectiveness no less than men. We will establish specialized military education and training systems to provide women with the same promotion opportunities as men, encouraging them to take on command positions. The military will no longer be a gender-homogeneous organization but a fighting collective defended by all socialist citizens."
  FRA_women_right_radical_administrative_desc:0 "The construction of government is not only about executing technology and policies but more about how to reflect socialist ideals and values within leadership. These ideals and values are first reflected in the fairness of political representation. Women should occupy an equal position in government with men. Women's voices are equally crucial, and we must ensure that women can participate equally in national political life. Women are not just guardians of the home; they can also be leaders of the nation's future."
  FRA_women_right_radical_proportion_desc:0 "In the past, female workers were often at the bottom of exploitation and oppression. Today, with the strengthening of union power and support from national policies, women's status has gradually improved. To further ensure that women can equally participate in production, we will push for gender equality policies in factories, ensuring equal treatment in wages, promotions, and working conditions. Female workers are not just operators in the workshop; they are the driving force of our society's revival."
  FRA_women_right_radical_end_desc:0 "We will submit a comprehensive women's rights proposal to the parliament, aiming to completely eliminate gender inequality in society. This proposal will involve broad reforms in areas ranging from family law, labor law, education, and healthcare, ensuring that women, both inside and outside the home, and in the workplace and society, can enjoy equal opportunities and dignity."
  FRA_administrative_start_reform_desc:0 "At the beginning of the revolution, we established a new type of administrative system to ensure that state power could be quickly and effectively implemented at all levels, driving socialist construction. However, with the continuous development of the country and changes in the external environment, whether the existing administrative model still meets the needs of the new era has become a question we must consider. Now, it is time for deep reflection and comprehensive reform of the administrative system to adapt to the country's future needs and enhance governance efficiency."
  FRA_administrative_reform_strength_desc:0 "The strength of the French Commune depends not only on economic and military power but also on the unified command of political centralization. The central government must have stronger control in the current complex international situation to ensure that the country can quickly respond to internal and external challenges. By strengthening central authority, we can concentrate resources, coordinate the work of various departments, and better mobilize national power to serve the socialist cause."
  FRA_administrative_reform_release_desc:0 "Excessive concentration of power can lead to the growth of bureaucratism and corruption. We must cautiously relax central control in certain areas, especially in local autonomy and local government management. By decentralizing powers and giving local and grassroots organizations more autonomy, we can stimulate local creativity and vitality, forming a more flexible and efficient management structure. This strategy of relaxing control does not weaken central functions but strengthens the entire national system's flexibility and adaptability through decentralization."
  FRA_administrative_reform_member_add_desc:0 "To strengthen administrative efficiency and national governance capabilities, we need to expand the size of the bureaucratic system, particularly in important economic, diplomatic, and security areas. By recruiting more professionals and optimizing personnel allocation at all levels of government, we can ensure that national policies are effectively implemented. Additionally, expanding the bureaucratic workforce will help meet the increasing social demands, especially in the process of national reconstruction and expansion, providing adequate human resources for various strategic plans."
  FRA_administrative_reform_member_reduce_desc:0 "A large bureaucratic system without proper management and supervision can become a breeding ground for inefficiency and even corruption. Therefore, we must carry out streamlining reforms to reduce redundant positions and unnecessary layers, optimizing the operation efficiency of the bureaucratic system. Streamlining the bureaucracy does not mean weakening its functions, but ensuring that each administrative institution operates efficiently through reasonable resource allocation, avoiding bureaucratic expansion and waste of resources. A streamlined bureaucracy will be more flexible and responsive."
  FRA_administrative_reform_letsgo_desc:0 "To improve the national administrative system, we will submit a comprehensive administrative reform proposal. This proposal will address the deficiencies in the current administrative system and propose a series of modifications and optimization measures, including adjusting the allocation of powers between the central and local governments, improving the selection and management mechanisms for bureaucratic systems, enhancing administrative efficiency, and strengthening political and administrative supervision. Through these reforms, we hope to establish a more efficient, transparent, and widely participatory administrative system that truly serves the people and the country."
  FRA_administrative_reform_decentre_desc:0 "Excessive concentration of power often leads to bureaucratism and administrative inefficiency, while a decentralized administrative model can better meet the needs of the people. We will gradually push for decentralization reforms, transferring some decision-making powers to local governments and grassroots organizations to improve administrative efficiency and responsiveness. A decentralized administrative model can not only alleviate the workload of the central government but also enhance overall governance through the practical experience and flexibility of local governments."
  FRA_administrative_reform_turns_desc:0 "Factional struggles within the government are often inevitable. Standardizing democratic mechanisms between factions to ensure that different factions can compete in a systemized framework is an effective way to prevent extremism and factional division. By establishing more transparent decision-making procedures and democratic discussion platforms, we can regulate interactions between factions, reduce internal conflicts, promote unity and cooperation, and ensure the unity and stability of the socialist path."
  FRA_administrative_reform_people_desc:0 "The core of socialism is to serve the people, and the people's supervision is the fundamental way to ensure that the government remains clean and efficient. We will institutionalize the strengthening of people's supervision and evaluation of government work, encourage the public to participate in administrative decision-making and implementation processes, and ensure that policies meet the needs of the broad masses. Through this people-centered supervision mechanism, we will continuously identify and correct issues in government work, enhancing transparency and public trust in the government."
  FRA_administrative_reform_new_list_desc:0 "To promote administrative reform, we will release a new list of bureaucrats, selecting high-quality talents who possess socialist ideals, professional abilities, and loyalty to important positions. This new list of bureaucrats not only represents the state's absorption of elite talents but also serves as a key step in advancing administrative system reforms and strengthening national governance. Through the inclusion of a new generation of bureaucrats, we expect to spark a revolution in both thought and action, injecting new vitality into the future of the French Commune."
  FRA_administrative_reform_ideology_desc:0 "All administrative reforms must be rooted in ensuring the purity of national ideology and adherence to the socialist path. We cannot tolerate any form of capitalist corruption, religious reaction, or other anti-socialist thoughts infiltrating our society. By prioritizing ideology, we will ensure that all bureaucrats strictly follow socialist principles, maximizing the contradiction between personal and class interests to guarantee the correctness and effectiveness of national policies. Every decision made by the administrative apparatus must serve the collective interests of society, not those of any minority interest group."
  FRA_administrative_reform_pure_desc:0 "During the process of administrative reform, ensuring the political loyalty of officials is one of the most important steps. Any actions deviating from the socialist path will be strictly examined and punished. We will establish a rigorous political vetting system to ensure that every official remains loyal to the core values and development goals of the French Commune. Political loyalty will be the primary criterion for appointments, and any actions contrary to this principle will be firmly purged."
  FRA_administrative_reform_pragmatism_desc:0 "To ensure political loyalty, we will implement a stricter political screening mechanism. Every public servant must undergo a thorough background check and ideological review before being appointed to ensure there is no anti-socialist tendency. Through this institutionalized process, we can effectively curb potential counter-revolutionary elements within the bureaucracy and ensure that every government decision aligns with socialist principles, promoting the healthy development of the French Commune."
  FRA_administrative_reform_new_standard_desc:0 "The new administrative standards will focus on efficiency, loyalty, and fairness, reshaping the government management system of the French Commune. Through the restructuring of the bureaucratic workforce and the establishment of new mechanisms, our government will enhance administrative efficiency and reduce the breeding of corruption and bureaucratism. The new standards will symbolize our national governance capabilities, ensuring that every policy is implemented in a timely and effective manner to maximize social benefit."
  FRA_administrative_reform_new_set_desc:0 "We will submit an administrative reform revision bill to further improve the existing reforms. This bill will cover all aspects of the administrative management system, particularly in strengthening collaboration between central and local governments, optimizing administrative processes, and improving the selection mechanism for officials. Through the implementation of these revisions, we will ensure that the administrative system of the French Commune is better adapted to the challenges of the new era and continues to safeguard the socialist cause."
  FRA_domestic_reform_start_desc:0 "After achieving revolutionary victory, we successfully established a new social order. However, over the following decade, changes in the social landscape have forced us to reassess domestic issues. Whether it concerns freedom of speech, social security, or basic rights of the people, every aspect needs careful design and continuous adjustments to meet the evolving domestic situation and societal demands. Through focusing on and reforming these key areas, we will further advance national stability and progress."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_desc:0 "Freedom of speech is an essential part of socialist construction, but the challenge is how to protect free expression while preventing the spread of reactionary and extremist ideologies. We will propose a reform of the speech system to ensure that the state can fully protect the right of every citizen to express themselves while preventing the infiltration of extreme and harmful views. The reform will emphasize the balance between freedom of speech and social responsibility, ensuring that the socialist cause remains the dominant theme."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_strict_desc:0 "To prevent the spread of capitalist and counter-revolutionary thoughts, we will implement a strict speech review system. All public expressions and publications will undergo state censorship to ensure they meet the ideological requirements of socialism. Through this system, we will effectively block the infiltration of hostile forces and capitalist ideologies, ensuring the dominance of socialist thought in society."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_strict_justice_desc:0 "The righteousness of thought is the foundation of our country's stability and development. We will implement a series of laws and policies to ensure that all public discussions align with socialist values and suppress any form of counter-revolutionary and extremist thought. By strengthening the guidance of ideological work, the French Commune will create a unified ideological environment, ensuring that every citizen participates in national construction under the correct ideological direction."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_strict_be_quite_desc:0 "To ensure the efficiency and fairness of the speech system, we will regulate the review process and establish a more transparent and effective censorship mechanism. All content that needs to be reviewed will be evaluated by professional teams, and the review results will be made public within a specified time. To avoid the abuse of censorship powers, we will set up a supervisory mechanism to ensure the fairness and transparency of the review process. Through this standardized approach, we can safeguard social stability while minimizing the impact of speech censorship."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_normal_desc:0 "In the current society, some groups believe that the existing speech system is reasonable and that the social discourse environment is relatively stable. For these voices, we should take a relatively moderate approach, maintaining the current level of speech control and continuing to enforce existing policies. This choice means we will continue to monitor all public speech closely but will not rush to make large-scale adjustments to the system, ensuring social stability and harmony."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_normal_update_desc:0 "We recognize that the contradiction between freedom of speech and social control cannot be solved immediately. Therefore, we propose a flexible speech mechanism that maintains the basic framework of speech censorship while allowing citizens more space for open discussion. Specifically, different levels of speech control will be applied depending on the sensitivity of the social domain and content. For more moderate and non-sensitive topics, freer discussion will be allowed, while content related to national security and ideology will continue to undergo stricter review standards."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_normal_reform_more_desc:0 "On the revolutionary path of the French Commune, counter-revolutionary speech remains one of the greatest threats to social stability. We will take strong measures to guard against any form of counter-revolutionary speech, particularly those seeking to restore capitalism, religious oppression, or other reactionary ideologies. Through enhanced public education, we will ensure that these reactionary ideas have no place in society and swiftly eliminate any counter-revolutionary forces attempting to infiltrate."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_normal_change_desc:0 "We will implement a moderate speech reform plan that gradually relaxes restrictions on public discourse while maintaining the purity of national ideology. This reform will ensure that the dominance of socialist thought remains intact while providing citizens with more space for discussion and expression. This gradual approach will expand the space for freedom of speech without compromising national stability, promoting diversity and openness in society."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_slack_desc:0 "In certain fields, we will lift excessive restrictions on speech, particularly in areas such as science, culture, and the arts, allowing for more exchange of ideas and innovation. This measure will help stimulate social creativity and productivity, injecting fresh ideas and vitality into socialist society. Of course, this relaxation will be strictly controlled within legal boundaries to ensure that no counter-revolutionary speech or extremist thoughts can take root."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_slack_complete_free_desc:0 "In the process of achieving socialist goals, we will always adhere to the freedoms and rights of the people, promoting institutionalized freedom of speech. We plan to gradually advance complete freedom of speech, allowing citizens to express any views, as long as they do not violate the core values of socialism or endanger national security. This reform is not only a respect for individual freedoms but also a reflection of the tolerance and diversity of socialist society."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_slack_limit_desc:0 "Although we are committed to safeguarding freedom of speech, certain expressions may pose threats to national security and social stability. Therefore, some speech will be subject to moderate restrictions based on the sensitivity and potential risks of the content. These restrictions will strictly follow the socialist values and societal security needs of the French Commune, ensuring that no form of expression harms the interests of the people or the long-term development of the state."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_slack_no_racist_desc:0 "We will not tolerate any form of extreme speech, whether religious extremism, racism, or other forms of radical thought. We will use legal measures to strictly combat the spread of these extreme views, preventing division and conflict within society. Any speech with inflammatory, hateful, or violent tendencies will be severely punished, ensuring the stability and harmony of the social order in the French Commune."
  FRA_domestic_reform_speech_end_desc:0 "We will submit a comprehensive speech system bill to the Labour Congress. This bill will ensure that the speech system is more flexible and adaptable to the development of the French Commune in the new era, both safeguarding the freedom of expression of the people and maintaining the socialist principles of the state."
  FRA_domestic_reform_security_desc:0 "The security of the state is a prerequisite for socialist construction. Only in a secure and stable social environment can we concentrate our efforts on developing the economy, culture, and other areas. To respond to the increasingly complex domestic and international situation, we must carry out comprehensive domestic security reforms to ensure that the French Commune can maintain its security and order in a turbulent world."
  FRA_domestic_reform_security_police_desc:0 "We will carry out a comprehensive overhaul of the police system to ensure that the police force is not only a tool for maintaining public order but also an important component of the national security system. Through retraining and redeployment of police officers, we will enhance their ability to combat revolutionary enemies and reactionary elements, ensuring that both domestic and international threats are dealt with in a timely and effective manner."
  FRA_domestic_reform_security_police_professional_desc:0 "We plan to professionalize the police force by selecting a group of highly trained and loyal officers to ensure that national security agencies can efficiently carry out their tasks. This professionalization reform will improve police efficiency, reduce corruption and negligence, and enhance the state's control over social order."
  FRA_domestic_reform_security_police_common_desc:0 "To adapt to the new demands of social governance, we will establish a public police officer system. These public officers will be responsible for handling daily affairs in areas such as public safety and law enforcement. They will possess both executive power and judicial authority to help maintain social stability and ensure the implementation of socialist policies."
  FRA_domestic_reform_security_police_people_desc:0 "The defense of the French Commune does not rely solely on the regular military but also requires the widespread mobilization of the people.

Currently, our advisory team is debating whether to prioritize rural or urban school expansion.\n\nThose advocating for rural schools argue this will improve the overall quality of our citizens and address long-standing neglect in rural areas, while also bolstering support among the peasantry. Urban school proponents present a more pragmatic case, citing higher birth rates in cities, thus justifying urban expansion.\n\nMoreover, schools are not only for children but also for adults seeking self-improvement. $FRA_jean_baptiste_lebas$ believes that education should be accessible to all, emphasizing that encouraging adults to return to school is equally vital for our revolution."

It is hard to criticize such behavior—isn't the pursuit of a better life a fundamental right?\n\nHowever, the absence of these satisfied individuals from politics leaves a gap filled by others. Those dissatisfied with life or society will naturally seek political expression, but focusing solely on the vocal populace inherently leads to an undemocratic system. Addressing grievances is essential, but we must not overlook the silent workers.\n\n$FRA_boris_souvarine$ has tirelessly worked to awaken those proletarians who neglect politics in their pursuit of a good life.

We lost territory but gained the people. Nevertheless, we will never forget the humiliation of the Great War, nor will we abandon our French compatriots living under German rule. The German workers, too, exploited by capitalism and monarchy, will one day see their socialist liberation.\n\nHowever, our revolution itself arose from opposition to war. While we understand that a conflict with the German Empire is inevitable, our people hope that such a war will not be initiated by us. While we could adopt a more radical anti-German strategy, it would undoubtedly fuel militarism and nationalism at home, potentially leading to actions beyond our control.\n\nOur leadership remains divided over the German question. One faction advocates for a more confrontational stance, while the other believes war is a disaster for all and argues that we should focus solely on ensuring our defensive capability against Germany.\n\nThe pro-war faction sees conflict with Germany not only as a means to settle past scores but also as a chance to reclaim the territories lost by the French Republic before the war. This stance is supported by the Sorelian faction, with other factions unable to oppose it outright due to patriotic sentiments. Only the Programmeists have expressed strong dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, the pro-peace faction asserts that war would inevitably force German proletarians into military service, turning the conflict into fratricidal slaughter among workers.

Although there are still many criticisms of the government of the Republic of China in our view, they are undoubtedly the most progressive force on the Asian continent. The Chinese people's desire for reunification is well-known, and despite the present warlordism on the Chinese mainland, it is likely that eventually, they will fall under a single regime. A unified China, with a population of 400 million, will have undeniable influence.\n\nTherefore, our support for the Kuomintang is not just about material aid between comrades, but rather to help them achieve the reunification of China, and even further, to use their influence in Asia to spread the red flag to neighboring countries.\n\nHowever, some of us believe that China is too vast. If we focus too much on China, our ability to assist revolutions in other parts of the world may be weakened. Thus, the affairs of East Asia ultimately depend on the left-wing nationalist Kuomintang, and we cannot effectively influence them—or perhaps we should not attempt to. Anarchists strongly argue that we should provide assistance without offering advice on the Kuomintang's revolutionary strategy. The Sorelists, on the other hand, disagree and believe we should not let a readily available revolution slip through our hands.

Therefore, the Nanjing government hopes we will assist in the construction of schools, libraries, hospitals, and other public facilities to help transform China's social thought.\n\nOur advisors strongly support this initiative.

Our forces cannot penetrate these areas.\n\nOur military advisors recommend abandoning most regions to focus on assaulting key enemy strongholds. While barricade warfare poses risks, the rebels lose mobility and are confined to defending specific areas. Concentrating our superior forces could crush them decisively.

This humiliating defeat has emboldened the rebels, who are now exploiting our withdrawal from other areas to expand their influence. Apart from a few military bases, Wallonia has effectively fallen."

Although we have caught several moles, intelligence suggests that there are still infiltrators among our forces.\n\nOur German advisors recommend dismissing all Wallonian personnel to eliminate potential infiltration.

Though eventually crushed by imperial forces, their actions inspired socialists throughout Germany.\n\nDespite the German government's ban on socialist movements, underground organizations emerged, driven by the will of the people. We have been in contact with these underground workers' groups, which number in the hundreds across Germany. From small groups of three to four people to organizations of thousands, they have managed to form a principal leftist socialist coalition—the Spartacist League, named after the Roman slave rebellion.\n\nAfter the outbreak of war, they reached out to us, seeking our help in igniting a socialist revolution in Germany. As the elder sibling of the Socialist International, it is our duty to assist. However, the deep-seated Franco-German enmity and the territorial issues along our borders cannot be ignored.

Although we have defeated the German Empire, the innocent German people, deceived by the Junker landlords and capitalists, have paid the price—they should have been on the same front as us. At the same time, our own country has a significant number of pacifists and anti-war activists, who have even influenced our military decisions. Regardless of their impact on us, we cannot deny that peace is the people's desire and should be the direction socialism embraces.\n\n[RUS.GetName] remains the only independent military power in Europe that can threaten us. Undoubtedly, our relationship with Russia will shape the entire European and even global landscape. Should we extend goodwill toward Russia? After all, no one wants another world war. However, some radical officers argue that since Russia is our ideological adversary and a rival we must confront, we should strike while our forces are still mobilized from the war against Germany and defeat Russia in one decisive blow.

[FRA.GetName], [ENG.GetName], and [RUS.GetName]—the major European powers—are all present at the Munich Conference. Keen observers can easily see that the socialist France and Britain hold an advantage over Russia. While this may allow the Third International to pressure Russia for greater concessions, such an imbalance could also provoke Russian resentment and even cause them to withdraw from the discussions—an outcome we must avoid at all costs.\n\nThe first day of the conference focuses on the disposition of the German Empire. Without question, all unequal treaties imposed by Germany on other nations will be abolished. However, disagreements arise over the division of German territory: Germany’s lands must be reduced, and Alsace-Lorraine should be returned to the French motherland, but what about the rest? The Russian delegation proposes dividing Germany along the Elbe River into a Third International occupation zone and a Moscow Accord occupation zone. Yet, considering the price we paid to defeat the Imperial Pact and our contribution to the war, we believe a 'fairer' approach is to dictate terms based on our strength."

While they were a major force on the Eastern Front, they might be exaggerating their contribution—after all, the Western Front was the main battlefield against Germany, and the German puppets in the East had little impact on the overall war. Nonetheless, this is a core Russian interest, and opposing it outright could risk breaking the negotiations unless we make significant concessions elsewhere.\n\nEven so, from a strategic perspective, we do not wish for all of Eastern Europe to fall entirely under Russian influence—at least not directly as annexed territories.

Instead, we and Russia will make arrangements on their behalf. This may seem unfair to them, but it is for the greater peace of Europe. While matters concerning the defeated nations should certainly be discussed with them, our immediate discussions with Russia focus on the division of influence. It is foreseeable that, after the war, Europe will be shaped by two equal spheres of influence: the Third International and the Moscow Accord.

This claim is an insult to our revolution, but our representatives restrained themselves from reacting emotionally and continued negotiating over the matter of reparations.

But now, who would dare say 'Workers of the world, unite!' is mere rhetoric? Starting from Europe, this nameless specter has continuously hovered over every corner of the capitalist world—where there is oppression, there is the spark of socialism. This is not a fairy tale but a reality unfolding before our eyes. There is no need for lamentation or hesitation—the wheels of history will mercilessly crush everything in their path, and we are the ones making history; we are history itself.\n\nFrom Europe, we shall spread the wildfire of socialism to Africa, Asia, the Americas, Oceania—to wherever oppressors still exist, burning away all hypocrisy and decay. Sound the horns of revolution! Beat the drums of victory! Turn the parasites that feast on our flesh into the nourishment of the earth! We will never rest, not as long as a single soul suffers from injustice and oppression. Socialism belongs to every slave who dares to rise up, to every worker who dares to fight, and to every comrade who dedicates themselves to the proletariat! The Internationale will be realized!"

  eupun.10.desc:0 "The similarities among Europeans outweigh their differences. To slaughter each other over meaningless national hatred is both foolish and inefficient. For centuries, the aristocrats and capitalists have manipulated national conflicts to safeguard their own interests at the expense of human lives, weaving a grand deception. Now, we must sever the chains that hinder European unity. \n\nHowever, from a pragmatic standpoint, convincing other political entities to relinquish their national sovereignty and instead become administrators of a multi-ethnic state is a monumental challenge. The simplest approach is to entice them with privileges—offering them recognition of European sovereignty while allowing them certain rights. Yet, this will inevitably become an obstacle to a truly unified European state. If we later wish to revoke these granted privileges, it will be a long and painful struggle. If they refuse outright, we won’t even have the chance to engage in this battle for reform. We must display strength—without it, we cannot lead the European Union. \n\nIdeology is another crucial issue. Each nation has its own ideological nuances, and these differences cannot be ignored. If we are to construct a unified Europa, ideological unity—or at least ideological hegemony—must be considered. However, this presents yet another obstacle, as the ideological leaders of each country will not willingly submit to us. \n\nThe national question and the ideological question alone are already giving us headaches, and we have yet to address the political structure and practical details of European unification. The vision of Pan-Europeanism is noble, but when we attempt to implement it, endless complications arise. Despite these challenges, we have resolutely chosen this bright path. Pan-Europeanism is not a fleeting dream but a vision worth dedicating everything to realizing."

  eupun.11.title:0 "Blueprints of Pan-Europeanism"
  eupun.11.desc:0 "As we embark on the practical process of European unification, the first issue to resolve is the structure of this new state. Without question, it must be a federation—after all, we are uniting multiple nations. However, federations come in different forms, and even small structural differences can lead to vastly different outcomes in practice. \n\nFor the long-term future, a centralized federation with absolute authority vested in the central government is the ideal choice. However, this would undoubtedly be seen as an affront to the sovereignty of the member states, or worse, as an insult to their entire national identity. On the other hand, a confederation—where unity is only nominal—would create significant difficulties in the integration process. We cannot grant too much power to the member states, or we will fail to establish a clear purpose for the European Union. \n\nA compromise appears to be the most viable option, but balancing power between the central government and member states is an immense challenge. How do we ensure unity while maintaining regional satisfaction? Perhaps the best course of action is to paint an idealistic vision—a grand promise that may ultimately be unattainable. After all, that is a trick politicians have long employed. At the core of it all, we must first make European unification a reality—only then can we consider how to sustain it."
