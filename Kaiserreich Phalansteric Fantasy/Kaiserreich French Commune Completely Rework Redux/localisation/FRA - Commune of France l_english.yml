 FRA_communard_spirit:0 "Communard Spirit"
 FRA_communard_spirit_desc:0 "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

 FRA_to_war_idea:0 "Revanchist Rearmament"
 FRA_to_war_idea_desc:0 "Our nation must rise again if we are to defeat the Imperialists!"

 FRA_renseignements_generaux_lar:0 "Renseignements Généraux"
 FRA_renseignements_generaux_lar_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux serve as the eyes and ears of the Commune, gathering intelligence on both domestic and international threats to our proletarian dream. But the RG's mission goes beyond mere security. They are also responsible for promoting the values and principles of our socialist revolution, both at home and abroad. Through their intelligence gathering and analysis, they help shape our foreign policy and are the first deployed in our efforts to break the global chains of Capital.\n\nWith sympathisers in every factory still owned by the bourgeoisie, our networks are unmatched."

 FRA_economic_reforms_anar:0 "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_anar_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco:0 "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_calibrate_the_economy_idea:0 "Calibrated Economy"
 FRA_calibrate_the_economy_idea_desc:0 "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

 FRA_ruralism_idea:0 "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_idea_desc:0 "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

 FRA_collective_properties_idea:0 "Collective Properties"
 FRA_collective_properties_idea_desc:0 "Private property is incompatible with freedom of the individual. This, in theory, is a principle even Orthodox Syndicalists agree with us on. However, for decades the old capitalist city planning and public norms have been left mostly unchanged, it is now time to put an end to this. With the promotion of communal living practices and the consolidations of coops into common property, our society is bound to become more equal and less wasteful."

 FRA_mass_production_idea:0 "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_idea_desc:0 "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

 FRA_modern_farms_idea:0 "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc:0 "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

 FRA_war_economy_and_agriculture_idea:0 "War, Economy and Agriculture"
 FRA_war_economy_and_agriculture_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

 FRA_technician_management_idea:0 "Technician Management"
 FRA_technician_management_idea_desc:0 "Too long have the Unions been left to manage the economy inefficiently without expert management. In order to put an end to economic chaos and ensure swift modernisation engineers, economists and other experts will be empowered to guide and veto union decisions when it comes to matters of the economy."

 FRA_sense_of_dedication_idea:0 "Sense of Dedication"
 FRA_sense_of_dedication_idea_desc:0 "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

 FRA_industrialization_idea:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_industrialization_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Barthélémy Montagnon, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

 FRA_working_women_idea:0 "Working Women"
 FRA_working_women_idea_desc:0 "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

 FRA_bhartiya_support:0 "French Military Support"
 FRA_bhartiya_support_desc:0 "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

 FRA_amenagement_du_territoire_idea:0 "Aménagement of the Territory"
 FRA_amenagement_du_territoire_idea_desc:0 "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

 FRA_plan_prost_idea:0 "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc:0 "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes:0 "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc:0 "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the Federal Police."

 FRA_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
 FRA_secret_police_desc:0 "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

 FRA_demo_surete:0 "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
 FRA_demo_surete_desc:0 "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

 FRA_hawkish_renseignements:0 "Revolutionary Renseignements"
 FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support socialist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

 FRA_peace_renseignements:0 "Protective Renseignements"
 FRA_peace_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea:0 "Peaceful Revolution"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea_desc:0 "The international socialist Revolution will come, but it will be civilised. With the main reactionary powers in Europe finally shattered and their workers liberated, we aim to encourage further uprisings by merely proving the superiority of Syndicalism to the whole world."

 FRA_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Revolutionary Spirit"
 FRA_revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "The survival and prosperity of the socialist world will only be ensured when the last reactionary bastion is terminated. We must stand ready to mobilise and shatter every reactionary government across the world. One day, the Internationale will extend across all seas and continents!"

 FRA_socialist_education_idea:0 "Socialist Education"
 FRA_socialist_education_idea_desc:0 "The education of the youth is one of the greatest goals that a country like the Commune may face. Luckily, the old education system of the Republic was already revolutionary for its day, giving us a good basis for the new one. A socialist education system, focused on the sciences and arts."

 FRA_international_avant_garde_idea:0 "International Avant-Garde"
 FRA_international_avant_garde_idea_desc:0 "A united socialist art style, from art to music, could be a powerful tool that will help masses in the non-syndicalist world get interested in our ideals - through entertainment."

 FRA_amenagement_du_territoire_desc:0 "Our territory is vast and unequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
 FRA_hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroelectricity"
 FRA_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our mountainous regions in the Alpes and the Massif Central have plenty of high flow rivers, a perfect environment to install a clean and lasting source of energy and revitalise the backwards, rural mountainous regions of the Commune."
 FRA_improve_the_electrical_network:0 "Improve the Electrical Network"
 FRA_improve_the_electrical_network_desc:0 "Thanks to the recent success of our efforts to expand hydroelectrical power generation, we can now use cheaper electricity to further boost our industrial capabilities.

 FRA_office_des_chemins_de_fer:0 "Office des Chemins de Fer"
 FRA_office_des_chemins_de_fer_desc:0 "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became.

 FRA_mining_expansion:0 "Mining Expansion"

 FRA_plan_prost:0 "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_desc:0 "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
 FRA_autoroutes:0 "The Autoroutes"
 FRA_autoroutes_desc:0 "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

 FRA_direction_of_the_economy:0 "Direction of the Economy"
 FRA_direction_of_the_economy_desc:0 "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."

 FRA_reduce_unemployment:0 "Reducing Unemployment"
 FRA_reduce_unemployment_desc:0 "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
 FRA_worker_designer_cooperation:0 "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
 FRA_worker_designer_cooperation_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques.

 FRA_improve_management_of_unions:0 "Improve Management of Unions"
 FRA_improve_management_of_unions_desc:0 "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy.

 FRA_sense_of_dedication_desc:0 "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole.

 FRA_communal_industrialisation:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_communal_industrialisation_desc:0 "Barthélémy Montagnon is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation.

A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
 FRA_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
 FRA_war_industry:0 "A War Industry"
 FRA_war_industry_desc:0 "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war.

 FRA_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories.

  comfrance.1.desc:0 "Since the revolution, there has been disagreement over the flag of the Federation. The red flag has always been the flag of the proletariat, the flag of the revolutionary martyrs, the flag of the battle trenches. Many believe that revolutionaries should only raise the red flag as a proud declaration of struggle against the bourgeoisie: after all, the proletariat has no homeland. For decades, the tricolor flag has ceased to symbolize revolutionary fervor, instead degenerating into a mere representation of the bankers' republic and the Versailles faction of 1871. However, many are still unwilling to let go of it. Some socialists, especially members of the Socialist Union, have long sought to reclaim this flag from the bourgeoisie, restoring its revolutionary spirit, just as the people did when they stood tall and victorious at Valmy against European monarchies. Or perhaps they simply fear that abandoning the red, white, and blue flag would be a serious provocation to the nations of the world, angering those who have not yet fully embraced our cause.\n\nTherefore, just as was done during the revolution, a compromise was reached. The tricolor flag was retained, but it was adorned with symbols of proletarian struggle, workers, and rebels, always flying alongside the red flag. Now that we have won the recent election, the final decision on this debate lies with us: should we maintain the 1920 compromise and keep the fractured tricolor, or should we preserve the compromise elements and create a new, more red flag, or perhaps simply allow the red flag to fly high alone, perhaps with more features that represent our faction?"

Now a well-respected voice in the movement, he has announced his bid in the 1936 presidential election for the SPA. Despite criticism at home and abroad that this would draw him towards reformism, the prospect of seeing a staunch socialist at the helm of the United States is too enticing for any fellow delegates to voice much concern, and Reed was given a warm welcome by the Congress. In his speech, he detailed the current situation in the United States:0 the Great Depression, now dragging on for years, has thrown American workers and farmers into atrocious conditions, leading to a rapid rise in radical politics, made worse by the German crash. The labour movement grows ever more powerful, the SPA is rapidly gaining ground in political institutions, and proletarian forces are holding strong against police repression and Longist reactionary militias:0 an opportunity seems bound to reveal itself."

Every day more workers join the struggle of this frontline of imperialism, and if we are to believe our comrades the entire continent is one push away from Liberation. A packed audience listened eagerly to heroic tales of Patagonian revolutionaries, latest updates from the still fresh Nicaraguan revolution or stories from veterans of the Mexican Revolution, which inspired the whole of Latin America.

However, what exactly this tremendous effort would be proved controversial and when the Congress finally reassembled for a voting session, debates lasted well into the night, with positions ranging from issuing a mere condemnation to calls for immediate armed struggle.\n\nUltimately, it was decided that a framework for deeper international collaboration would soon be established under the auspices of the Third Internationale and socialist great powers. Help towards the development of socialist economies, greater economic integration, research and development programs, as well as permanent international cooperation councils would help the world's free nations act as one to prepare for the final struggle. Simultaneously, initiatives to more concretely support socialist efforts in capitalist nations would be undertaken, both openly and covertly. Naturally, details would still be left for governments to fill in, but the proposal was approved almost unanimously. Only one thing was left to vote on, the name of this initiative. A French delegate proposed the 'Phalanstère', in homage to the harmonious and self-sustaining communities established by utopian socialist Charles Fourier, a proposal which proved instantly popular:0 by building this International Phalanstère, the workers of the world will soon conquer the utopia they have earned."

As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause.

The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Neosocialist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

Years of Sorelian rule and the streamlining of procedures and production for the war effort have made this demand a formality:0 Valois and his government are already nearly all-powerful. Naturally, all appearances have been dutifully maintained:0 Sorelian rethoric is one of radical syndicalism, and the election of the CNS was to be a reform towards the ethos of the revolutionary days. But slowly, surely, power was concentrated in the hands of Sorelians. Proletarian democracy is alive, but it serves only one mistress:0 the grand historical, revolutionary purpose of all Frenchmen, the War to save civilisation itself from bourgeois decay.\n\nValois is more comfortable with courteous theoretical debate than grand speeches. His leadership has reflected this temperament, and though often forceful, to not say violent, the Sorelians have a rather placid leader. Comrade Valois did not have the makings of a dictator and did not wish to be one:0 he sees himself as merely imbued by the accidents of History with the role of unworthy guide of the French proletariat. But today Valois found within himself oratory skills on par with the greatest revolutionary tribunes. Passionately arguing for the executive to be granted emergency powers, so that once and for all the Revolution may triumph first across Europe, then the World, he concluded his speech with a promise to hunt down Reaction wherever it may hide, to rapturous applause. He had found, of course, a receptive audience:0 believers were enraptured, remaining adversaries did not wish to wake up tomorrow to armed comrades accusing them of counter-revolutionary activity. And so a vote granting the government vast emergency powers nearly unanimously passed, as enthusiastic representatives shouted "Vive Camarade-Chef Valois!""

Camarade Valois, eager to mingle with his fellow worker-combatant, is never too busy to salute them, listen to stories from the front, hear about the heroic sacrifice of a comrade. This time, it was a cavalry unit, federal dragoons. Though their horseback-riding days were behind them and these were now a fierce mechanised force, tip of the spear driven into Reaction's darkened heart, the spirit of the cavalry remained strong:0 brave or foolhardy, critics would say aristocratic, but none could deny their courage. As Comrade Valois reviewed these troops, his eye was caught by a bright, blood-red banner affixed to the leading tank:0 crimson flying proudly, adorned with the Sun's flaming rays, in its heart the symbols of the Revolution.\n\nImpossible to mistake it, the symbol was in every history book:0 this was an ad hoc reproduction of the Oriflamme, the ancient kings of France's sacred war banner, the golden flame cleansing away their enemy, updated to serve the Proletariat. When Valois inquired about this odd sight, an increasingly nervous officer attempted to explain this was nothing more than a unit tradition, initiative from soldiers reviving childish dreams of chivalry. He was no doubt expecting scandal, perhaps punishment, as before the Comrade-Chief cut him off he was attempting to assume full responsibility. Instead, Valois was full of enthusiasm:0 indeed, what better way to show the inherent revolutionary character of the French nation that to root our symbols in those of the glorious victories of our ancestors? The Frenchman has always been a mover of history, our past is nothing to shun. So full of enthusiasm in fact, that the Chief promised the banner would soon be flown alongside the federal and red flags, reintroduced as France's war banner in her grand civilisational duty."

Years and after years, intense mobilisation on this day led to more street confrontations, often more victims. On this International Workers' Day, soon known colloquially as Labour Day, proletarians refused to work, and marched for their rights, waving the red flag, singing the Internationale, wearing the red eglantine or the lily of the valley wrapped in scarlet cloth on their jackets in memory of the bloodshed. This commemorative, oppositional holiday, this day of freedom snatched from the jaws of Capital, rightfully shook the bourgeoisie.\n\nWith the Revolution, the First of May was declared a national holiday and quickly became a day of great official celebrations and commemorations, marches, popular events and dances. At home, a celebration of the Revolution and the liberated workers, abroad still a day of struggle, until one day the wind of revolutionary freedom blows on all corners of the Earth.

It is expected that, barring an unthinkable reversal, the now-former members of the alliance beyond the reach of enemy forces will soon cease open hostilities, while the rest will eventually be forced to surrender unconditionally... or otherwise suffer eventual debellation.\n\nAs the flame of revolution burns out and the workers cry in despair, all that remains is to find whatever salvation we can..."

The Third Internationale was created by French socialists after the 1920 revolution and has since helped steer the efforts of the labour movement. Dominated by syndicalists, the Internationale however intends to be a broad-tent organisation and thus welcomes reds of all stripes. Delegates were greeted by a military parade and a rousing speech in Versailles, clad in red for the occasion.\n\nAt the top of the agenda is the spread of revolutionary fervour, particularly to Asia and North America, conflict in Spain, policy on colonialism and requirements for membership of the Internationale's military alliance."
 comfrance.1037.a:0 "An interesting development."

 comfrance.1038.title:0 "The Tenth International Congress"
 comfrance.1038.desc:0 "The Ninth Congress of the Third Internationale, held in Paris, dealt with spreading the ideology overseas, supporting socialist movements and strengthening the ties between existing socialist nations, and thanks to the gathering's success, the Tenth International Congress has been called, to be held in London.\n\nRepresentatives from the entire world were greeted by a British artillery salute, a Scottish bagpipe chorus and an overall warm reception. As Europe rolls closer and closer to war, military and economic cooperation between the socialists is expected to be the primary topic of discussion, and France and Britain will once again call the shots on the Internationale's policy."
 comfrance.1038.a:0 "Interesting."

 comfrance.1039.title:0 "Creation of the International Avant-Garde"
 comfrance.1039.desc:0 "A combined effort by the Commune of France and the Union of Britain a few days ago has birthed the International Avant-Garde, a programme that aims to create a united art style for art and genre for music, as well as new literary techniques, each of them encouraged to be socialist, unorthodox, anti-traditionalist and anti-religious.\n\nIt's reported that artists, writers and musicians from all around the world will participate in this programme, from the United States to South Africa to Japan. The first festival to show off the fruits of the programme is planned to happen within two years at Cannes. Is this the dawn of the new, syndicalist entertainment?"
 comfrance.1039.a:0 "Solidarity forever!"

Pierre Monatte has had an immense influence on our nation, leading us confidently for over a decade now. Born on January 15th, 1881, he was a renowned trade unionist before the Great War and had been unjustly arrested several times for various syndicalist 'crimes' against Capital, such as his participation in righteous protests in the aftermath of the Courrières mining disaster. Having quickly risen through the ranks of the General Confederation of Labour, he was even briefly forced into exile by the Republic's repression of the movement. When the War broke out, he was of the few to dare say a resounding no to collaboration with the bourgeois government, shortly before being sent to the front. This prescience and his reputation as a stalwart, tireless revolutionary meant that when the time came, Monatte played a critical role in the overthrowing of the old order, and was in an excellent place to steer the new proletarian course of our nation.\n\nBecoming one of the main organisers of the 'Orthodoxes', and certainly their most influential member, his leadership led the union of the previously feuding 'Centrists' and 'Ultras' to victory in the 1926 elections, capturing the Presidency. A master politician, Monatte has managed to stay afloat through a fragile coalition with the Anarchists, ever juggling their demands, along with the other, fractal factions that are so important in the parliament. Yet the man at the top will always be a target, and to say the position he holds is coveted would be an understatement. As knives sharpen in every dark corner, how long can the light keep them at bay?§!"

He developed a primal rage for the landlord and the factory-owner, led a wildcat strike against his landlord when he was twelve, and fully devoted himself to the impending revolution since he was seventeen, after witnessing the Revolution of 1905. He led anarchist study groups, skirmished with the police, and was ultimately convicted to a life sentence of hard labour.\n\nSickly, yet energetic, Makhno was released after the February Revolution, and immediately travelled to Ukraine to continue his work. Now, he was no longer a propagandist, but a revolutionary leader. After being briefly exiled from Huliapole due to the German occupation, he bore witness to the rise of the Bolsheviks, which he denounced as a "paper revolution" and returned home in July 1918. There, he set up the Revolutionary Insurgent Army and began a year long war of resistance against the Germans and Ukrainian nationalists. Though brutal and not at all educated in army affairs, Makhno earned the favour of the countryside and gave the Hetman a much tougher fight than expected before being forced to flee. Ultimately, he arrived in the Commune of France, which he immediately denounced as yet another paper revolution. Uninterested in its intellectual foundations, Makhno merely saw disunity, inaction and oligarchy which threatened to overturn the accomplishments of the Revolution by creating yet another aristocracy. Much like Bolshevik exiles, he was integrated into the Federal Army, and earned a following with tales of his exploits - however, he was a maverick in the officer corps, clashing with his superiors and ignoring his duties. Neither him nor the Army were satisfied, so, Makhno left for the wider world - serving in revolutionary volunteer corps throughout the post-war to further the world revolution instead. This path has brought him to Patagonia - where he can serve the cause while being out of mind for the Communards.§!"
