  jacobinism_subtype:0 "Vanguard Jacobinism"
  jacobinism_subtype_desc:0 "§YVanguard Jacobinism§!\n\n"Vanguard Jacobinism" is an ideology formulated by former French communists Jacques Doriot and Henri Barbé. It seeks to synthesize Saint-Simon's concept of the 'industrial state,' the revolutionary terror of Robespierre and the Jacobins, and the secretive organizational model of Blanquism, while absorbing certain leftist socialist elements from Marxism–Leninism. To its proponents, factions of the French Revolution represented early forms of true socialism—they cared for the urban proletariat and the poor, despised corrupt elites, and harbored an intense anti-clericalism. To liberate the masses from the 'opiate of religion' and instill rational worship, they would not hesitate to drown priests in the river. Above all, they believe that real revolution cannot come from parliamentary speeches, but only from decisive action."

  neo_socialism_subtype:0 "Neo-Socialism"
  neo_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§YNeo-Socialism§!\n\nNeo-Socialism, as envisioned by comrades Marcel Déat and Adrien Marquet in their <Neo-Socialist Manifesto>, aims to address the crises of the modern world. It strives to strike a balance between slow reformist transformation and the failures of radical revolution—especially after witnessing the chaos and inefficiency of early Commune reconstruction and parliamentary infighting. Its foremost goal is to 'construct the revolution' by establishing an authoritarian technocratic government backed by popular support, tasked with completing the social transformation that old socialism failed to achieve. A follower of Jean Jaurès' pacifism, Neo-Socialism maintains distance from militarism and prefers peaceful cooperation to realize internationalism—so long as it does not undermine France's interests."

  sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§YSorelianism§!\n\nModern Sorelianism, as the name suggests, draws its core from the ideas of Georges Sorel—the great thinker, philosopher, and revolutionary, honored posthumously as the Eternal President of the Commune. Before his death, nearly every revolutionary syndicalist identified as a Sorelian. After his passing, his comrade Georges Valois took up the mantle and declared a new form of 'Sorelianism': the old myth of the General Strike had served its purpose in toppling the old order. In a worker state already founded, a new, stronger, and more unifying myth was needed—one that transcends class struggle and instead builds unity on loyalty to the nation, glorification of combat, and collective sacrifice. The ultimate aim is to forge a warrior community of unified will and sublime spirit."

  futurism_subtype:0 "Youthism"
  futurism_subtype_desc:0 "§YYouthism§!\n\n'Youthism' is less a political doctrine and more an eternal revolution of the soul. It rejects all stale narratives built on nationhood, revenge, or tradition, and turns inward. It fuses Sorel's aesthetics of irrational violence with surrealist dreamscapes, Freud's desire, and Nietzsche's Übermensch. It cares not for national borders, only for the frontiers of existence; it seeks not the political emancipation of a class, but the liberation of life itself from the suffocating grip of civilization and reason. It is the heresy at the heart of France—a movement of artists and madmen—not meant to build a new state, but to create "the New" itself."

  union_syndicalism_subtype:0 "Unitarian Syndicalism"
  union_syndicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§YUnitarian Syndicalism§!\n\nUnitarian Syndicalism is a cry of rebellion against the bureaucratization of traditional syndicalism. Heavily inspired by the idea of the 'One Big Union,' it scorns trade-specific unions as mere 'medieval guilds.' This school of thought calls for the demolition of all industry barriers and the unification of workers into a single, grassroots-controlled, militant organization. It advocates for thorough union democracy, returning power to the workers on the shop floor, and ultimately replacing all hollow parliamentary bureaucracy with a fully administrative Confédération Générale du Travail, enacting direct rule by the working class."

  tent_syndicalism_subtype:0 "Big Tent Revolutionism"
  tent_syndicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§YBig Tent Revolutionism§!\n\nRather than a pure ideology, Big Tent Revolutionism is a pragmatic art of governance rooted in realism. Its adherents understand that a post-revolutionary state is riddled with cracks and contradictions, and any radical upheaval risks total collapse. Thus, its primary task is to preserve unity and stability under the 'big tent' by compromising with negotiable forces and pursuing incremental, non-fundamental reforms to patch the system. To radicals, this is bureaucracy and betrayal—but to itself, it is the only path forward under the heavy burden of revolution."

  anarchism_subtype:0 "Anarchism"
  anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "§YAnarchism§!\n\nAnarchism is the purest and most uncompromising wing of the revolutionary spectrum. It is the eternal enemy of the state—whether it be the bourgeois state or the increasingly bureaucratic 'workers' state'. Inheriting the legacy of pioneers like Proudhon and Bakunin, and incorporating the organizational lessons of the 'Programmatists', anarchism seeks one absolute goal: the abolition of all forms of centralized power, with authority returned entirely to free communes and cooperatives. It envisions a society built on voluntary association, direct democracy, and mutual aid as the ultimate form of human liberation. Its one and only enemy is the state apparatus itself."

  wp_communism_subtype:0 "Worker-Peasant Communism"
  wp_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§YWorker-Peasant Communism§!\n\nWorker-Peasant Communism is a form of Marxism shaped through the trials and compromises of real-world politics. After witnessing the failures of more radical paths and the gridlock of parliamentary struggle, it abandons the purist focus on urban centers and the slogan of 'class against class'. Instead, it forges a more pragmatic alliance of workers and peasants—rooted in groups long neglected by the establishment: rural farmers, non-unionized laborers, and the petty bourgeoisie. While still committed to Marxist principles, it fights more flexibly within the current political system to expand the voice and material gains of the classes it represents."

  national_communism_subtype:0 "Council Communism"
  national_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§YCouncil Communism§!\n\nCouncil Communism is a more radical strain of left-wing communism, deeply distrustful of reformist or pragmatic approaches it sees as dangerous paths to betrayal. Holding fast to orthodox Marxist-Leninist principles, it acknowledges that immediate violent revolution may no longer be realistic, but insists that 'workers' councils'—or soviets—are the highest and final form of proletarian democracy. Its core demand is that the revolution must culminate in a state entirely governed by workers' councils, and it remains mercilessly critical of all forms of bureaucracy and parliamentary politics."

His fate seemed predestined: after an accident, the 30-year-old Jouhaux became Secretary General of the CGT, and later played an active role in the revolution.\n\nFollowing the revolution's victory, Jouhaux remained a central figure. He worked closely with Sorel and, after Sorel's death, called for unity and rejected division—though he could not prevent the Sorelians' departure. After the Syndicalists broke with the Anarchists, Jouhaux continuously sought reconciliation. Although a full alliance could not be reestablished, relations remained cooperative. Privately, he expressed a certain sympathy for the defeated Leninists in Russia, and despite open hostility from the Worker-Peasant Communists toward Syndicalists, Jouhaux has quietly worked to ease tensions between opposition factions and the CGT.§!"

He rose quickly in the CGT, and repression forced him into brief exile.\n\nWhen the war began, he was one of the few who clearly refused collaboration with the bourgeois state. Thanks to his foresight and tireless dedication, he was pivotal in overthrowing the old regime and charting a new proletarian path. As one of the most influential figures in the Syndicalist faction, he led them to victory in 1927 alongside the Anarchists.

His deep hatred for landlords and factory owners was born from these harsh experiences. At twelve, he led a wildcat strike, and by seventeen he fully participated in the 1905 Revolution. Makhno headed anarchist study groups and clashed with police, eventually sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labor.\n\nReleased during the February Revolution, despite illness, he quickly returned to Ukraine to resume revolutionary activities. No longer just an agitator, he became a revolutionary leader. With German forces occupying Huliaipole, he was briefly exiled, witnessing what he called a "paper revolution" by the Bolsheviks. Returning home in July 1918, he organized a revolutionary insurgent army, waging a year-long war against German troops and Ukrainian nationalists. Though brutal and untrained militarily, Makhno gained peasant support and forced the Hetman into bitter battles before defeat and exile.\n\nHe arrived in the French Commune but condemned it as another paper revolution, disinterested in its theory but seeing only division, laziness, and oligarchy—a new aristocracy stealing the revolution's fruits. Like many Bolshevik exiles, he joined the federal army, winning followers through his exploits but clashing with officers and shirking duties. Dissatisfied both with the army and vice versa, Makhno eventually left for broader revolutionary struggle, serving as a volunteer in revolutionary armies and ultimately reaching Patagonia—where he could fight for the cause without being subjugated by Commune bureaucrats.§!"

He willingly became Sorel's guardian of doctrine rather than seeking to leverage Sorel's influence for his own gain. Valois saw himself as a warrior—shaped by his military service during the Great War, where he came into contact with the 'real people.'\n\nDuring the revolution, although Sorel's health was failing, Valois continued to transmit the messages of this revolutionary syndicalist mentor: an urgent call to launch a general strike! Despite conciliatory socialists and syndicalists trying to calm the situation, fearing the loss of their influence to genuine revolutionary syndicalists, they chose to declare war on the corrupt bourgeois republic, and thus civil war officially erupted.\n\nAfter the revolution's victory, Sorel, as the leader of revolutionary syndicalism, naturally became the Commune's most important figure, though due to his poor health he was only a 'symbolic authority.' While many publicly respected this wise man, Valois understood it was mere political pretense. Indeed, after Sorel's death, those who once 'respected' him began to divide his political legacy, each claiming to be the true revolutionary syndicalist appointed by Sorel—yet none had been at his deathbed.\n\nUnable to tolerate the rapid degeneration of these former revolutionaries, Valois led loyal Sorelians out of the Grand Alliance. He understood what the dying old man had thought: after the birth of the revolutionary state, Sorel's ideas had changed. The general strike was a means against the bourgeoisie, but after revolution, other answers were needed. Chaos and infighting could not forge victory. The once-mythic worker had failed, and the revolution must find a new myth to unite behind. Valois knew the answer: those who had experienced the Great War understood meaning better than the lofty parliamentarians—not abstract metaphysics, but meaning forged by blood and iron.§!"

  Cof_weak_central_government:0 "Weak Central Authority"
  Cof_weak_central_government_desc:0 "Before the revolution, the idea of local commune federations was widely considered the most likely revolutionary model. After the revolution, perhaps due to commitments to ideals or sheer inability to unify the nation, decentralization was established: the central government struggles to counter local decisions, while localities exert influence in the central government through their representatives. Although the local level also operates a dual system of parliaments and committees as checks and balances, this exists mostly in theory, with local political bosses monopolizing legislative and executive powers. Although the central government’s Public Security Committee can theoretically issue orders to local committees, resistance—both overt and covert—means that, on the local level, central orders are almost 'nonexistent.'\n\nWhile many anarchists or localists support this model, from the national perspective, it poses a major problem for cross-regional resource allocation. Regional disparities have existed since the old Republic. Without the central government’s ability to allocate resources across regions, France’s regional development will become even more unbalanced and distorted. Regardless of ideology, as long as one holds socialist ideology, this situation cannot be ignored."

  cofstory.1.desc:0 "The autumn harvest festival is the liveliest day of the year in the village. The air is filled with the scents of baked bread, apple cider, and bonfires. The lively accordion melodies mingle with the laughter of people, echoing through the small square. Émile sits with his mother, yet he feels like an outsider. He knows that after the festival's noise, he must choose a path for his life.\n\n"You should go see Paris, Émile!" Sophie, his lovely childhood friend, squeezes beside him holding two glasses of bubbling cider; her eyes shine brighter than the festival’s fire. She slips an envelope into his hand, bearing the Sorbonne University crest. "This is a recommendation letter for the ’People’s Polytechnic Development Program’ arranged by my cousin in Paris! Think about it—engineer, scientist... that’s France’s future! We can’t spend our lives smelling only the earth." Her words brim with yearning for the outside world.\n\nAt that moment, Uncle Jean-Pierre approaches, his loud voice overpowering the accordion. "Future? Stability is the future!" He kindly pats Sophie’s head, then turns to Émile with a serious look. "Child, I’ve applied for you to be an advanced apprentice at the Pitot Armory. It’s a respected job, a real guarantee. Only under the CGT’s wing can you settle down and build a family, not chase those elusive dreams in Paris."\n\nOn the other side of the bonfire, Luc and several taciturn veterans drink strong liquor, out of sync with the festival’s joy. Luc sees Émile and waves. Approaching, Émile smells a strong mix of tobacco and gunpowder. "They want to buy you with ’future’ and ’stability,’ don’t they?" Luc’s voice is low and rough like sandpaper. "Look at us, Émile. We are France’s past—and its only future. When your ’future’ is crushed by German tanks, when your ’stability’ is burned to ashes by their shells, you’ll realize the only trust is in the rifle in your hand. Alsace awaits, and so do we."\n\nAs he prepares to leave, Mark calls him from the corner, handing out candy to children. "They all want to take you away from here," Mark says with a simple, sincere smile, "but have you thought about staying? For this village, for our elders, to do something. We are setting up a night school to teach reading, writing, and counting harvests. We need someone like you—who knows the land but also thirsts for knowledge—to be a teacher. Revolution doesn’t have to be in Paris; it can take root right here on our soil."\n\nThe bonfire slowly dies down; it’s time to go home. Émile walks home with his mother; the evening breeze brings the fields’ calm. His mother squeezes his cold hand gently and whispers, "Many spoke to you today, didn’t they? Émile, my child, don’t listen to them. Listen to your own heart—where does it want to go?""

  cofstory.2.title:0 "A Girl’s Choice"
  cofstory.2.desc:0 "Early in the year, sunlight pierced through the morning mist over Lyon, entering the small apartment of the Girot family. Adèle Girot was no longer the girl who felt distant and confused about politics. Over the past year, her father’s angry outbursts about factional struggles at the dinner table, and her mother’s late-night worries about the family’s future, had carved deep marks into her heart. She knew she could no longer be just an 'unwilling citizen.' She had to make a choice.\n\nStanding by the window, she watched the busy streets below come to life. Her future, like the city itself, stretched out along several very different paths.\n\nShe remembered the CGT Family Day her father took her to last week. In the spacious dining hall of the silk factory, representatives of the local General Confederation of Labour acted like benevolent patriarchs, personally handing pensions and convalescent certificates to retired workers. Children played happily in the yard, their faces full of carefree smiles. It was a vast, warm collective that sheltered everyone within. Her father had already arranged a clerical position for her in the Women’s Union. It was a smooth, stable path—becoming a well-cared-for cog in this enormous collective.\n\nBut posters advertising enrollment for the Lyon Public Normal School were also plastered on a street corner. She recalled her high school teacher taking them to visit the newly built city hall. In the bright and tidy archives room, the teacher pointed to neatly classified dossiers, speaking almost reverently: 'Children, this is order, this is reason. A strong state is made up of countless precise and reliable screws.' The teacher said her intelligence should not be wasted. The state needed her to be part of this precise machine. It was a path toward a broader world, filled with a sense of mission.\n\nAt the other end of the city, there was a different scene. She recalled last month when her friend, a somewhat rebellious art student, dragged her to an underground exhibition. In a dilapidated attic, bold and unruly paintings mocked all authority. Artists debated loudly amid swirling smoke, discussing 'the complete liberation of the individual.' 'Why should we be cogs or screws?' her friend’s eyes burned with fire. 'We should be ourselves! Artists, thinkers, revolutionaries! Adèle, true revolution is a revolution of life!' It was a chaotic, dangerous, yet vibrantly alive world.\n\nBut what truly shook her was what happened last week. A loud explosion came from the textile factory at the end of the block—a steam pipe had burst. She and her neighbors rushed out, only to see chaos—crying, injured workers, union stewards at a loss. The ambulance was delayed. Then, a truck painted with red crosses and gear emblems sped over. A group of young volunteers wearing simple uniforms and red armbands jumped out. They were the ’Nationale-Syndicaliste’ volunteer rescue team. Without slogans or hesitation, their movements were like a precise machine. They calmly bandaged, stopped bleeding, and lifted stretchers with burning focus in their eyes. In that hellish scene, they were the only light. It was a calling to devote one’s will to rescue and sacrifice.\n\nAdèle turned and saw her mother silently watching her, eyes full of love and understanding.\n\n"Have you made up your mind, my child?" her mother softly asked."

  cofstory.3.title:0 "Windows and Textbooks"
  cofstory.3.desc:0 "After the rainy season, a brand-new schoolhouse rose at the east end of the village. The scent of wood mixed with paint, and children excitedly chased and played beneath the new windows. All of this was thanks to the 'Rural Education Funding Act.' Émile Vogt watched it all with unprecedented satisfaction. He had chosen to stay, and his choice seemed to be paying off.\n\nParis sent fresh textbooks, slates, and chalk. For the first time, Émile’s night school had a proper classroom. During the day, he taught children reading and writing; at night, he taught adults how to keep cooperative accounts and understand weather forecasts in agricultural newspapers. What he taught was exactly what they needed, knowledge to make their lives a little better. He felt he was doing the most right and practical work in all of France.\n\nUntil the arrival of the ’instructor comrade’ from the National Education Committee.\n\nHe was a young man, about Émile’s age, dressed in a sharp uniform, speaking with a Parisian accent and unquestionable confidence. He praised Émile’s work, then pulled out a nationwide standardized ’Rural Education Directive.’\n\n’Comrade Émile,’ he said, pointing to the directive, ’your enthusiasm is commendable, but the methods need to be standardized. Farmers need to know not only how to calculate harvests but also understand the grand revolutionary narrative. Starting next week, the night school must add four hours weekly of ’Commune History and Political Theory.’’\n\nÉmile opened the new political textbook, full of faction struggles within the BGT, decrees from the Comité de Salut Public, and some philosopher quotes even he barely understood.\n\n’But… comrade,’ Émile hesitated, ’Uncle Jean-Pierre and the others just want to know why fertilizer prices are up again this year. They can’t read this.’\n\nThe instructor’s smile stiffened. ’That is precisely the purpose of education, Comrade Émile. To raise political awareness so they can understand. It is state policy. Your task is to implement it.’\n\nThat week, when Émile first wrote on the blackboard ’On the Inevitability and Checks of Bureaucratization in Syndicalism,’ he saw those familiar faces—neighbors tired from a day’s fieldwork—with the same bewildered and distant expressions he had seen when hearing politicians speak.\n\nA brand-new window was opened, bright light shining in. But along came a heavy textbook, dictating what you must see out the window. Émile looked out at his family’s vineyard and felt a flicker of doubt for the first time about his choice."

  cofstory.4.title:0 "A Letter to the Vineyard"
  cofstory.4.desc:0 "The autumn nights in Paris came earlier and colder than back home. Émile Vogt sat at the narrow desk in the Sorbonne dormitory, outside the never-ending lights and faint clamor of the Latin Quarter. He unfolded a sheet of paper, pen poised but still hanging in the air. He missed the smell of soil in the vineyard. Finally, he began to write, to his friend Pierre.\n\nPierre, my dear friend,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well.\n\nLately, Paris has been abuzz with discussions about the newly passed Comprehensive Education Act. The dorm and dining hall are full of heated and excited debates. I don’t understand all the big ideas, but I’m certainly at the center of this change.\n\nI never thought I could learn so much. The library here is bigger than our whole village, shelves reaching as high as cathedral vaults. I have seen dam blueprints that can redirect rivers, touched precise machines that can do a month’s work in an hour. The teachers say that we, selected through the 'People’s Polytechnic Development Program,' are the cornerstone of this new law, the hope to build a strong, new France. Sometimes late at night, looking at these blueprints, I feel an unprecedented thrill. I think, if I learn this well, maybe the old irrigation ditch in our hometown will never run dry in summer again.\n\nBut, Pierre, the more I see, the more confused I become.\n\nSince the law passed, everything changed. In my dorm is a boy from Brittany who writes the most beautiful poems I’ve heard—they smell like the sea. But last week, his scholarship application was rejected because, according to the new law’s spirit, literary creation is not a national priority technical field. I saw him crying silently at the end of the hall that night.\n\nI also see classmates born in Paris, dressed well, loudly praising the 'reason and order' brought by the law. Some mock our provincial accents in the dining hall, causing laughter. In their eyes, we ’polytechnic program’ students might be no different from the old machines that need 'optimization.'\n\nThis law is like a huge sorting machine. Efficient and powerful, it selects 'useful' parts from all over the country, bringing them to Paris for polishing and tuning. But what about those filtered out? Those equally talented, but not prioritized? Those compatriots like us who were not selected?\n\nWe are building a stronger France—I have no doubt. But I often wonder, my dear friend, in this brand-new building we’re constructing, is there still a window left open for those left behind, those we know?\n\nSend my regards to your family, to Uncle Jean-Pierre, and everyone. Tell them I miss the smell of ripe grapes.\n\nYour friend,\nÉmile"
