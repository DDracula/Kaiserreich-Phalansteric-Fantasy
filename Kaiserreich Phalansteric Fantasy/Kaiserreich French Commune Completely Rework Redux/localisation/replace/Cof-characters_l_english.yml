  FRA_leon_jouhaux_leader_desc:0 "$faction_synd$ - $faction_synd_mode$\n§YBorn:§!§L July 1, 1879; Paris, Seine, French Republic§!\n§YBackground:§!§L Léon Jouhaux was born into a revolutionary family—his grandfather took part in the 1848 Revolution, and his father fought in the 1871 Paris Commune uprising. His fate seemed predestined: after an accident, the 30-year-old Jouhaux became Secretary General of the CGT, and later played an active role in the revolution.\n\nFollowing the revolution's victory, Jouhaux remained a central figure. He worked closely with Sorel and, after Sorel's death, called for unity and rejected division—though he could not prevent the Sorelians' departure. After the Syndicalists broke with the Anarchists, Jouhaux continuously sought reconciliation. Although a full alliance could not be reestablished, relations remained cooperative. Privately, he expressed a certain sympathy for the defeated Leninists in Russia, and despite open hostility from the Worker-Peasant Communists toward Syndicalists, Jouhaux has quietly worked to ease tensions between opposition factions and the CGT.§!"

He rose quickly in the CGT, and repression forced him into brief exile.\n\nWhen the war began, he was one of the few who clearly refused collaboration with the bourgeois state. Thanks to his foresight and tireless dedication, he was pivotal in overthrowing the old regime and charting a new proletarian path. As one of the most influential figures in the Syndicalist faction, he led them to victory in 1927 alongside the Anarchists. His leadership has kept this fragile coalition afloat—balancing chaos in the legislature and navigating treacherous waters.

His deep hatred for landlords and factory owners was born from these harsh experiences. At twelve, he led a wildcat strike, and by seventeen he fully participated in the 1905 Revolution. Makhno headed anarchist study groups and clashed with police, eventually sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labor.\n\nReleased during the February Revolution, despite illness, he quickly returned to Ukraine to resume revolutionary activities. No longer just an agitator, he became a revolutionary leader. With German forces occupying Huliaipole, he was briefly exiled, witnessing what he called a "paper revolution" by the Bolsheviks. Returning home in July 1918, he organized a revolutionary insurgent army, waging a year-long war against German troops and Ukrainian nationalists. Though brutal and untrained militarily, Makhno gained peasant support and forced the Hetman into bitter battles before defeat and exile.\n\nHe arrived in the French Commune but condemned it as another paper revolution, disinterested in its theory but seeing only division, laziness, and oligarchy—a new aristocracy stealing the revolution's fruits. Like many Bolshevik exiles, he joined the federal army, winning followers through his exploits but clashing with officers and shirking duties. Dissatisfied both with the army and vice versa, Makhno eventually left for broader revolutionary struggle, serving as a volunteer in revolutionary armies and ultimately reaching Patagonia—where he could fight for the cause without being subjugated by Commune bureaucrats.§!"

After meeting Marcel Déat, they quickly became close friends and used the Bordeaux model as an example to construct "Neo-Socialism."\n\nAfter founding the Parti Socialiste de France, Marquet quickly implemented Neo-Socialist reforms in Bordeaux. Although Neo-Socialism was largely derived from the Bordeaux model, the results were remarkable: Bordeaux rapidly became one of the fastest-growing local communes.

He willingly became Sorel's guardian of doctrine rather than seeking to leverage Sorel's influence for his own gain. Valois saw himself as a warrior—shaped by his military service during the Great War, where he came into contact with the 'real people.'\n\nDuring the revolution, although Sorel's health was failing, Valois continued to transmit the messages of this revolutionary syndicalist mentor: an urgent call to launch a general strike! Despite conciliatory socialists and syndicalists trying to calm the situation, fearing the loss of their influence to genuine revolutionary syndicalists, they chose to declare war on the corrupt bourgeois republic, and thus civil war officially erupted.\n\nAfter the revolution's victory, Sorel, as the leader of revolutionary syndicalism, naturally became the Commune's most important figure, though due to his poor health he was only a 'symbolic authority.' While many publicly respected this wise man, Valois understood it was mere political pretense. Indeed, after Sorel's death, those who once 'respected' him began to divide his political legacy, each claiming to be the true revolutionary syndicalist appointed by Sorel—yet none had been at his deathbed.\n\nUnable to tolerate the rapid degeneration of these former revolutionaries, Valois led loyal Sorelians out of the Grand Alliance. He understood what the dying old man had thought: after the birth of the revolutionary state, Sorel's ideas had changed. The general strike was a means against the bourgeoisie, but after revolution, other answers were needed. Chaos and infighting could not forge victory. The once-mythic worker had failed, and the revolution must find a new myth to unite behind. Valois knew the answer: those who had experienced the Great War understood meaning better than the lofty parliamentarians—not abstract metaphysics, but meaning forged by blood and iron.§!"
