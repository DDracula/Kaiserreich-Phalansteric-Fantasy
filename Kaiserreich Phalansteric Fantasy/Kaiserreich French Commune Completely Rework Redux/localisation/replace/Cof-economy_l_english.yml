Instead, they have been frequently hindered by local civilian opposition to the CGT. In 1932, the once-chaotic Communal economy seemed to show signs of unification, but in hindsight, it appears to have been merely a brief resurgence. It seems the future of the Communal economy will be difficult to decide within this single five-year term."

The next day, the news of Martin's loss spread through every street, with headlines screaming: 'Lucien Martin Loses Labor Dispute against the CGT.' Three days later, the Association des Fédéralistes Anarchistes (AFA) announced it could 'no longer tolerate the bureaucratic style of the CSR and the CGT' and withdrew from the governing coalition. The PSF's party newspaper, L'Ouvrier en Marche, also publicly questioned the Syndicalists' right to rule.\n\nFive days later, discontented crowds took to the streets in protest. Then-BGT Chairman Monatte and CSP Chairman Pivert managed to calm the situation and maintain the administration's operation. However, a year later on May 13, the crowds surged again, demanding reform of the CGT, a reversal of Martin's case, and the dismissal of implicated CGT officials. That protest ended with an extra-legal compensation granted to Martin.\n\nToday, May 13, 1936, the crowds have returned to seek justice for Martin and countless workers with similar experiences. After the chaos of the previous two marches, this time there are no signs of lumpenproletarian rioting or looting. Perhaps after the new elections, the people see hope again: starting with the reform of the CGT, moving toward a total reform of the economy."

  cofeconomy.3.title:0 "A Worker's Misfortune"
  cofeconomy.3.desc:0 "In the early spring of 1934, the life of Lucien Martin, an ordinary worker at a small machinery plant in the Paris suburbs, was shattered by an accident. Mr. Martin was a diligent, slightly introverted middle-aged man who had not joined any union—not out of political opposition or indifference to the revolution, but simply because he believed that as an independent laborer, he could still contribute to the construction of the Commune. He believed that post-revolutionary France would protect every citizen.\n\nHowever, due to management negligence and aging equipment, an accident severely injured his arm, permanently depriving him of the ability to engage in heavy physical labor. According to Communal labor regulations, the factory should have paid his medical expenses and provided compensation. But the factory's union committee was entirely controlled by CGT members; they granted him only a pittance as a 'sympathy payment' on the grounds that Martin was 'not a registered union member and had never contributed to the Union Solidarity Fund,' and crudely dismissed all further appeals.\n\nFor Martin, this was not just an economic dead end, but the collapse of a conviction. He attempted to resolve the issue through the local Labor Arbitration Committee, only to find the committee was also composed of CGT representatives. His case was dismissed before even reaching a formal hearing. He was told: 'Citizen, the CGT is the protector of the workers. If you choose to remain outside this collective, you cannot fully enjoy the guarantees it provides.'"

  cofeconomy.4.title:0 "The Will of the Opposition"
  cofeconomy.4.desc:0 "Martin's plight quietly circulated in his community and among small, independent worker groups. Initially, it was just the private grumbling of those marginalized by the CGT's massive system. But soon, the 'Platformist' anarchists noticed the case. To them, Martin's dilemma perfectly exposed the worsening bureaucracy and privilege under Syndicalist rule—an organization that was supposed to represent all workers had become a massive interest group serving only its own members, even becoming a new oppressor.\n\nAnarchist newspapers, led by Le Libertaire, began reporting on the matter, using 'L'Affaire Lucien Martin' as a symbol to attack the CGT's monopoly. The articles caused a sensation, especially among non-CGT workers and intellectuals dissatisfied with the establishment. However, faced with the mainstream propaganda machine controlled by the Syndicalists, these voices remained faint at first.\n\nYet, through the mediation of anarchist activists, the case reached the desk of France's most prestigious lawyer—Henry Torrès. Torrès was not only a giant in the legal world but a member of the PCOP himself. A regular at L'Humanité, he shared a close personal friendship with party leader Marcel Cachin. However, Torrès always placed revolutionary principles above partisan views; he loathed rigid bureaucracy and sympathized with certain anarchist ideas regarding individual liberty. It was this trait that made him a bridge trusted by both anarchists and communists. Cachin and Torrès both understood that while the case was initiated by anarchists, it was a golden opportunity to strike at their common political rival—the Syndicalist establishment."

  cofeconomy.5.desc:0 "Torrès was incensed by the blatant injustice in the case. He announced he would represent Lucien Martin pro bono. He issued a public statement: 'I am defending not one man, but the principles of the Revolution. If the laws of the Commune cannot protect the most ordinary laborer like Mr. Martin, then who exactly do they protect? Does this Red flag fly for all the people, or only for members of certain organizations?'\n\nTorrès' intervention instantly escalated the lawsuit from a local labor dispute into a national political trial. Inside and outside the courtroom, the streets were empty as people flocked to watch. With his matchless eloquence, Torrès tore the CGT legal team to shreds. He did not get bogged down in tedious legal technicalities, but aimed directly at the system itself. He asked the court, and all of France: Must a worker join a specific organization to be recognized as a 'true worker'? Has the power of the unions become so great that it can replace the laws of the state?\n\nThe final verdict was no surprise. The court dismissed Martin's appeal on the grounds that 'the Arbitration Committee's decision was not improper according to current internal union regulations.' Legally, Henry Torrès lost. But politically, he won an overwhelming victory. When the result was announced, the entire Commune was in an uproar. This failed trial proved to everyone in the most irrefutable way that the CGT's power indeed stood above the law. It confirmed all the opposition's charges and deeply stung the ordinary populace who held pure ideals for the revolution."

  cofeconomy.6.title:0 "Trip to Bordeaux"
  cofeconomy.6.desc:0 "'It’s so clean,' Jacques couldn't help but marvel as they first walked the streets of Bordeaux. Every stone was perfectly fitted, and trams glided by quietly with a pleasant hum. The buildings along the street were as orderly as if measured by a ruler, and even the pedestrians' steps possessed a purposeful vitality. To Jacques, this place was like a meticulously maintained, giant engine, full of power and efficiency.\n\nThey entered a 'Communal Store,' and Jacques was instantly drawn to the wide array of goods on the shelves. Canned food, bread, cloth, tools... everything was in ample supply, categorized, with prices clearly marked on small blackboards. He excitedly said to Marie: 'Look! This is what socialism should look like! No shortages, no chaos, everyone gets what they need.'\n\nHowever, when Marie eagerly wanted to buy a bottle of local red wine for their honeymoon, they encountered their first trouble. The clerk politely refused their Parisian Francs, informing them that only 'Bordeaux Labor Vouchers' were accepted here. For this bottle, they traveled across half the city, finally finding a person in an obscure corner who looked like a black-market broker to exchange a few crumpled vouchers at a highly unfavorable rate.\n\nJacques' displeasure quickly vanished at that night's 'Communal Canteen.' In a spacious, bright hall, hundreds of comrades sat together, sharing a sumptuous dinner. The air was filled with a warm, familial atmosphere. A talkative foreman struck up a conversation with Jacques, enthusiastically introducing Bordeaux's industrial achievements and inviting him to join a production seminar after dinner. Jacques felt an unprecedented sense of belonging; he felt this was the true meaning of the word 'Comrade'—a united, struggling family.\n\nBut Marie appeared somewhat constrained. She sipped the mellow red wine exchanged for vouchers, yet her eyes could not move from the eager, collectivized faces around her. She whispered to Jacques: 'The people here are very friendly, Jacques, but... I feel like an intruder. I can't even find a place where I can just talk quietly with you alone. Our honeymoon seems to have become part of a collective activity.'\n\nJacques was stunned. He looked at the unconcealable loss in Marie's eyes, then at the people around him immersed in collectivistic happiness, and for the first time, a slight doubt about the cost of 'perfect order' surfaced in his heart."

  cofeconomy.7.title:0 "Trip to Calais"
  cofeconomy.7.desc:0 "From the moment she stepped onto the soil of Calais, Marie felt like a fish returned to water.\n\nThe air was a mix of salty sea mist, bitter coal smoke, and the clamor of crowds. There was no silence like in Bordeaux; instead, there was a vital, slightly messy freedom. Marie pulled Jacques along, excitedly weaving through crowds of various complexions and accents. Using her fluent English, she bought two tickets for the latest play from a British sailor and discovered an exquisite brooch handmade from shells at an open-air market.\n\n'Here, I feel like an independent individual, not just a part of some collective,' Marie said to Jacques, her eyes sparkling. They entered a small second-hand bookstore where the owner, an old man with glasses, was leisurely drinking tea. Marie bought an old edition of Baudelaire's poems with a few Parisian Francs; the owner didn't even ask where she was from, merely smiling as he gave her change.\n\nHer favorite experience was at a handicraft workshop. she set her heart on a beautiful candlestick made of stained glass fragments, but the owner, a young female artist, told her: 'I don't take money here, comrade. But I happen to need someone to help me distribute these new leaflets to the sailors at the docks. Would you be willing to exchange your labor for mine?'\n\nMarie gladly agreed. She spent an afternoon talking with all sorts of people at the docks, distributing leaflets calling for 'Global Workers' Unity.' When she returned to the inn with that unique candlestick, she felt an unprecedented sense of satisfaction. This was an exchange based on voluntary cooperation, equality, and mutual aid—exactly the social relationship she yearned for.\n\nBut Jacques saw the other side. He saw the loading and unloading at the docks was entirely unplanned, with different union groups undercutting each other to grab a deal. He also saw a drunken sailor harassing passersby on the street with no 'Public Security Comrades' coming to stop him. 'It’s too chaotic here, Marie,' he told his wife one night. 'Freedom is fine, but freedom without order only leads to the exploitation of the weak by the strong. How is this different from the old world?'\n\nMarie did not argue. She merely watched the flickering flame on the candlestick and said softly: 'Perhaps. But at least here, I feel I can breathe.'"

  cofeconomy.8.title:0 "Trip to Marseille"
  cofeconomy.8.desc:0 "If Bordeaux was a precision machine and Calais a free beach, then Marseille was an erupting volcano.\n\nJacques was instantly captivated by the city's passion. Bold futurist graffiti was everywhere, and the air carried a spicy, vital scent. The people here seemed to have inexhaustible energy; they weren't just working, they were 'fighting.' Jacques saw with his own eyes the harbor cranes swinging with the precision and power of giant arms, accompanied by the workers' sonorous songs.\n\nThe order here was an internal, disciplined passion. One afternoon, they were invited to visit an 'Avant-Garde Theatre' composed of dockworkers. In an abandoned shipyard, the workers used searchlights and metal percussion to perform a modern dance drama about revolution and sacrifice. That raw, unadorned sense of power set Jacques' blood on fire. 'This is the revolution!' he told Marie excitedly. 'Not talk in an assembly, but power from the heart!'\n\nHe even arm-wrestled with a group of Great War veterans in a 'Workers' Club,' drinking cheap but potent pastis. He lost miserably yet laughed incredibly happily. He felt he had merged into a true 'Brotherhood,' finding that pure comradeship long lost in the offices of Paris.\n\nBut Marie remained an outsider throughout. She appreciated the art but was unsettled by the omnipresent collectivism. When she wanted to read quietly in a cafe, a group of cheerful youths approached, warmly inviting her to join their 'Philosophical Debate Group' on the topic of 'The Role of Myth in the Post-Revolutionary Era.' She politely refused, yet could sense a hint of incomprehension and disappointment in their eyes.\n\n'Everything here is purposeful, Jacques,' Marie said softly in the inn. 'Art is for propaganda, debate is for unifying thought, even drinking is to enhance combat camaraderie. I can't find any space that exists purely for the 'individual'.'\n\nJacques wanted to argue but didn't know where to start. He loved the power and sense of purpose here, but Marie's words also woke him up. Does this guided passion, this organized fanaticism, also mean the suppression of the individual will? When everyone marches toward the same 'Myth,' where can those who do not wish to walk that path go?\n\nOn the day they left, Jacques looked at the giant slogan on the station wall—'Workers, Nation, Revolution'—his heart filled with complex feelings. He yearned for the power here, but also began to fear what that power looked like when out of control."

  cofeconomy.9.title:0 "In Paris"
  cofeconomy.9.desc:0 "Back in their familiar apartment in Paris, the scenery outside remained the same, but the inner worlds of Jacques and Marie could never return to the past.\n\nJacques threw himself back into his daily union work. In the past, he would have been irritated by every inefficiency and complained about tedious approval processes. But now, seeing colleagues arguing until red in the face over the specifications of a single screw, he thought of that precise, efficient social machine in Bordeaux. He thought that perhaps a little 'order' wasn't a bad thing. Yet, seeing the CGT leadership again use privileges to profit their own faction, he thought of the unrestrained fair exchange in Calais and Proudhon's ideals.\n\nMarie plunged into preparations for the bar exam. The heavy Civil Code of the Communal Federation exhausted her. She wondered: if laws could be as clear and efficient as those planned by the technocrats in Bordeaux, how good would that be? But reading clauses on union privileges, she thought of Lucien Martin from the 'Case against the CGT'—the ordinary man ruthlessly crushed by the system. She began to question: what is the meaning of a law that does not protect the individual, even if it is 'efficient'?\n\nConversations at the dinner table became richer and heavier than ever before.\n\n'The people of Bordeaux seem prosperous,' Jacques would say, 'at least they don't worry about livelihoods.'\n\n'But the price is their personal choice, Jacques,' Marie would retort. 'Just like in Calais, though chaotic, at least everyone is free.'\n\n'But Calais's freedom is too cold,' Jacques sighed, 'I prefer that... passion in Marseille. Though that passion is terrifying.'\n\nThey discovered for the first time that the word 'socialism' possessed so many distinct faces on the soil of France. Order and chaos, collective and individual, efficiency and freedom, myth and reality. Those once distant philosophical concepts were now transformed into specific, minute feelings from their journey.\n\nOne evening, walking by the Seine and looking at the familiar night view of Paris, they still loved this city—loved its freedom and prosperity—but now, that love contained a layer of complex reflection. The trips to Bordeaux, Calais, and Marseille were like a three-sided prism, reflecting different facets of daily life in Paris and illuminating the confusion in their hearts.\n\nNo place was a perfect utopia. Life is forever a search for balance. And their country, their Commune, seemed to be at a critical point of imminent imbalance."
  cofeconomy.9.a:0 "“Perhaps,” Marie said softly, “the question isn't which is better, but whether we can find a path for everyone.”"

  cofeconomy.10.title:0 "Us and Them"
  cofeconomy.10.desc:0 "The end-of-shift bell rang, and Alain walked out of the Renault factory gates, his heart filled with a settled, almost proud emotion. The decree on the radio about the expansion of the CGT's power was like a sedative, filling him with confidence for the future. He decided to have a drink at the corner tavern to celebrate this victory belonging to them.\n\nThe tavern was smoke-filled as always. He saw Julien, a neighbor living below him who worked in an independent printing workshop. Alain walked over with his glass, warmly patting his shoulder. 'Julien! Come, I’ll buy you a drink! A great day, isn't it?'\n\nJulien slowly looked up, his eyes lacking the joy Alain expected, containing only a cold, distant fatigue. 'Yeah, Alain,' he said softly, a hint of mockery in his voice, 'it's a great day for you, indeed.'\n\nConfused, Alain asked: 'For us? Julien, what are you talking about? Aren't we all comrades?'\n\nJulien let out a laugh cooler than the tavern air. 'Comrades? My workshop is closing next week because of your new 'production qualification review.' My son wants to be an apprentice but was turned away because he doesn't have that little red booklet. And you—you live in apartments with balconies, you go to the seaside for convalescence, your children have the best paths. Are we and you still comrades?' He leaned in closer, lowering his voice, every word hammering into Alain's ears: 'You aren't comrades, Alain. You are the new aristocracy. Wearing workers' clothes, speaking revolutionary words, but how are you different from those fellows of the old era?'\n\nThe word 'aristocracy' hit Alain like a bolt of lightning. That was the word they used back then to describe those sent to the guillotine. He opened his mouth but found he couldn't say a single word. Several surrounding tables watched them silently with complex expressions—sympathy, anger, and even schadenfreude. The glass in Alain's hand suddenly felt impossibly heavy. He set it down and left the tavern in a daze. The night wind of Paris hit his face, and for the first time, he felt a bone-chilling cold. That solid fortress built for him by the union seemed to transform into a high wall in Julien's eyes—a cold, towering wall separating him from countless 'comrades'."

  cofeconomy.11.desc:0 "Alain's apartment was filled with the aroma of stew as his wife busied herself in the kitchen, humming a new tune from the radio. The announcer read the latest decree passed by the Bourse Générale du Travail in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\n'...Aiming to break rigid economic structures... improve production flexibility... grant local cooperatives and non-union enterprises more autonomy...'\n\nAlain stopped wiping his tools. Those words he didn't understand. But he understood the meaning behind them. He pulled out the slightly worn CGT membership booklet from his pocket. This booklet didn't just mean a stable job. It meant he was prioritized for this balcony apartment instead of being squeezed into smaller, damper rooms like his non-union neighbor. It meant his son could easily enter the Puteaux Arsenal as an apprentice with a bright future, rather than competing on 'equal terms' with countless others for a spot at a textile factory. It meant that every summer, his family could go to the CGT sanatorium on the Côte d'Azur for two weeks of sun and sea.\n\nThese, he had always taken for granted. This was the revolution's reward for its loyal cornerstones.\n\nBut now, the state seemed to be redefining the meaning of 'reward.' 'Flexibility,' 'Autonomy.' These words were like cold chisels, chipping away at the foundation of his comfortable life. He imagined the factory director—that Jacobin believer who always spoke of 'performance' and 'efficiency'—with a satisfied smile. He saw a sign saying 'Job Competition' placed next to the familiar lathe he had operated for twenty years. He saw sanatorium spots requiring a 'lottery draw' and his son's apprenticeship facing 'annual assessments.'\n\nThe solid, level road paved for him by the union seemed to be getting razed. The road was still there, but it was no longer exclusive to him. Everyone was being pushed to the same starting line, and he was no longer young.\n\nA chill rose up his spine. What he was about to lose was not bread, but the butter spread on it, the glass for drinking wine, the window overlooking the square.\n\nThe radio voice continued, but Alain could no longer hear anything."

  cofeconomy.12.title:0 "Boiling Silence"
  cofeconomy.12.desc:0 "After that massive march, Paris entered a period of eerie calm. The Comité de Salut Public issued a lengthy statement, promising to 'establish a cross-departmental special committee to comprehensively and prudently study the role of the CGT in the Commune's economic and social structure.'\n\nIt was a classic move, attempting to use time and bureaucratic procedures to cool down boiling public opinion.\n\nBut they were wrong.\n\nIn the eyes of the opposition, this statement was not an appeasement, but a provocation; not prudence, but cowardice. This silence became a breeding ground for various radical ideas to grow wildly.\n\nCirculation of Le Libertaire doubled. Anarchists and communists went street to street, whispering in the ears of every non-CGT worker that the so-called 'Special Committee' was merely a lie to stall for time, and only thorough, bottom-up change could bring true fairness. In the worker canteens of Belleville, discussions about 'class enemies within the working class' became open and fierce for the first time.\n\nJacobin newspapers packaged the government's hesitation as ironclad proof of the Syndicalist system's failure. They juxtaposed the clear production directives of the 'Bordeaux Model' with the endless bickering in the Parisian assembly, every article silently screaming: 'Look at this inefficient chaos! How much longer will you endure it?' Technocrats and the dissatisfied middle class hailed these newspapers in their clubs.\n\nAnd the most dangerous sparks were lit in the city's shadows. Sorelian followers distributed pamphlets in veterans' taverns and secret youth student meetings. They declared that the government's incompetence proved the spirit of the entire Commune had become decayed and weak. They didn't talk of reform, only of 'purification' and 'rebirth.' They said when a nation dares not even cut open its own wounds, it needs a sharper knife from the outside to help.\n\nThis undercurrent soon turned from words into action. Brawls broke out between CGT members and non-union workers at Lyon silk mills; local cooperatives in Nantes publicly announced their refusal to fulfill supply contracts with CGT-affiliated factories; in the army, debates over 'loyalty to the Commune' versus 'loyalty to the union' kept officers awake all night.\n\nThe government wanted a blanket of silence, but what they got was the suffocating, boiling silence before a volcanic eruption. All of France had become a boiler with rising pressure, while the valve responsible for venting it had been welded shut."

Smokestacks emit smoke, trains race along the tracks, and production figures in newspapers climb year by year. However, a discordant noise is coming from inside the machine, from the gaps in every gear, clearer and clearer.\n\nInitially, this sound only echoed in the cafes of Paris and the lecture halls of universities. Editorials in L'Ouvrier en Marche began to dissect the efficiency of the 'Bordeaux Model' and the chaos of the existing system with sharp pens; Le Libertaire serialized depth reports on the plight of non-union workers, questioning if the revolution had birthed a new privileged class. These articles circulated among intellectuals and dissatisfied groups like stones thrown into a pond, creating ripple after ripple.\n\nSoon, this noise spread to the streets. From the docks of Marseille to the textile mills of Lyon, workers complained about the chaotic regulations between different local communes; in the vineyards of the Loire Valley, peasants quietly cursed the grain procurement prices that served only urban interests. A money order sent from Calais to Bordeaux might shrink in value along the way due to different local ordinances. 'One France, countless economies'—this folk irony was becoming an irrefutable reality.\n\nThe anniversary march of the 'Case against the CGT' became the fuse to ignite all discontent. This time, it wasn't just anarchists and communists on the streets. Jacobin supporters carried signs for 'Order and Efficiency,' while Sorelian veterans shouted slogans for 'National Unity.' The once seemingly unbreakable Syndicalist consensus was being torn apart by the centrifugal force of reality. The BGT fell into endless bickering, and CSP directives found themselves unable to move an inch locally.\n\nThe machine could no longer pretend everything was normal.

The 1925 currency and finance reform was an attempt to form the fragmented Communal economy into a whole; however, the concessions the CSR gave to court the AFA in the 1927 elections caused economic leadership to fragment once more.\n\nThe '1925 Economic System' is the political policy model implemented after the first large-scale economic reform and the compromise with the anarchists: with local authorities holding primary economic power, the CSR-led CSP used its weak influence to regulate the direction of regional economic development. This model persisted until now, although after the 1934 'Case against the CGT,' local voices in their own economies grew louder as the CSR fell into controversy. Superficially, the '1925 Economic System' is still considered the current economic model of the Commune.\n\nAfter the outbreak of Black Monday, we as a socialist state should have welcomed it, but what followed were voices of opposition. Especially after the anniversary march of the 'Case against the CGT,' the clamor for economic reform has grown louder. Not just from factions originally opposed to the Syndicalists, but even the Syndicalists themselves have become radicalized, hoping to truly establish an economic model consistent with Syndicalism.

But today, the harbor is enshrouded in an eerie, anxious silence.\n\nAndré Bertrand, Chairman of the Marseille Port Labor Council and an old syndicalist who has struggled under the CGT banner for his entire life, stands at his office window, brow furrowed. The stack of telegrams in his hand has grown thick, each one feeling like a heavy ballast stone.\n\nA telegram from a Lyon silk mill—they desperately need high-quality long-staple cotton imported from Egypt, but the ship carrying the goods has been stalled in the Mediterranean for a week; the captain says he hasn't received a letter of credit from any bank to pay harbor fees. A telegram from the Puteaux Arsenal—the special steel they need from neutral Sweden is stuck in some Baltic port because the German shipping company responsible for transport went bankrupt overnight. Most fatal is from the Renault factory—the last batch of South American rubber on their production line is only enough for three more days.\n\n'Red Economic Circle'? 'Independence and Autonomy'? André smiled bitterly. He only now understands that their so-called independence was built upon a global machine composed of countless invisible gears belonging to the capitalist world. They proudly refrained from participating in that financial gamble, yet never expected that when the table was overturned, the entire casino would be locked down.\n\nThe telephone rang sharply. It was Paris, the Delegate for Economic Affairs' office. The voice on the other end was young and panicked, asking why the port was backlogged with so many tractors and cloth ready for export. André interrupted him tiredly: 'Comrade, the problem isn't that our things won't sell. The problem is that other people's things won't come in. Without rubber, how do tractors get tires? Without dye, cloth is just a pile of white rags!'\n\nThe other end fell into a long silence. André knew that the person on the other end, like himself, had seen the terrifying truth: the giant industrial machine of the Commune of France, while not collapsing like the casino in Berlin, had its blood vessels rapidly clogging due to a lack of external blood. The machine was about to fall silent.\n\nThis crisis was unlike any they had anticipated.

But now, that world has fallen into paralysis within its own madness, and the global trade lifeline we relied on is snapping inch by inch before our eyes. Ships are stalled in distant ports, letters of credit become scrap paper, and our factories are about to fall silent for lack of basic raw materials.\n\nThis is a crisis our theorists never foresaw: a crisis of matter, not capital.\n\nOpponents gather like flies smelling blood, screaming that this is the inevitable evil fruit of our 'degenerate' trade with the capitalist world; they would rather have the people embrace an idealized poverty for the sake of ideological 'purity.' But they forget that without the trade they spit upon, it is precisely our people who must pay the price for this 'purity.'\n\nStockpiles are reaching critical levels. We must find a new way out before the machine completely rusts through."

  cofeconomy.15.desc:0 "Outside is an angry tide of protesters and unemployed workers. On the desk are reports of factory closures and bank bankruptcies, piled like mountains. Our world—this great order built of gold, steel, and free markets—is swaying in the storm of 'Black Monday' like a house of cards. Our people are starving; our machines are rusting.\n\nIn this desperate moment, a telegram arrived from the most unlikely place—Paris, the sinful abyss of Red revolution.\n\nThe Commune of France, our sworn enemy, actually extended an 'olive branch.' Their wording was polite, but between the lines lay a condescending arrogance. They said their economy was immune to financial collapse due to its 'superior socialist system,' and their factories were still running at full speed. Now, 'in the spirit of humanitarianism,' they are willing to engage in 'pragmatic cooperation' with us.\n\nThis is a naked transaction, a contract with the devil. They are willing to provide us with the industrial manufactured goods we desperately need—machine tools, tractors, medicine, even some consumer goods—to help us stabilize our collapsing society. In exchange, they demand access to the natural resources within our (or our sphere's) territory—oil, rubber, grain... and our precious gold reserves.\n\nIn the cabinet meeting room, the arguments nearly tore the roof off. The military and conservative elders were livid, believing this was the most vicious insult to our national dignity, an act of idiocy to fund the enemy to hang us. However, the Minister of Economy and the industrialists anxiously pointed out that without these supplies, we might not survive the winter. Riots will evolve into revolution, and we will perish in our own civil strife.\n\nThe burden of choice falls on our shoulders. Is it to maintain ideological purity and dignity, or to drink this poisoned wine from the enemy for the sake of survival?"

  cofeconomy.16.desc:0 "The silence of the harbor has not dissipated, and the touch of machines cooling for lack of raw materials feels as if it lingers on the fingertips. We have all experienced the feeling of powerlessness when the chain connecting us to the world snaps. We once thought ourselves an independent continent, only to find ourselves an island in the vast ocean.\n\nBut now, a telegram has been sent from Paris through the Third International's Red communications network, like a bolt of lightning illuminating the mist. It brings not condolences, but a blueprint—a grand conception to build a new world on the ruins of the old.\n\nThe comrades in Paris declare in the telegram that they have found the answer to this crisis. they call it the 'Self-Sufficiency Plan'—a gamble to declare war on nature itself, a creative act to squeeze fuel from coal and cultivate rubber in laboratories.\n\nBut that isn't the whole story. The latter half of the telegram truly reveals their ambition. They propose expanding this internal French revolution into a common cause for the entire Third International. They invite us, and all core comrades, to jointly establish a true 'Red Economic Circle'—a completely self-consistent Red fortress connected by our own fleets, coordinated in production by our own plans, and supplied cyclically by our own resources.\n\nThey are willing to share everything: from the chemical formulas of synthetic fuels to greenhouse blueprints for modern agriculture. What they offer is not a handout, but an invitation to build together. This is a historic choice. Is it to join this grand, hope-filled, and unknown plan led by Paris, or to search for our own ark alone in this global storm?"

  cofeconomy.17.desc:0 "The union branch of the Renault factory organized a weekend picnic on the banks of the Marne. Accordions played cheerful tunes, children chased each other on the grass, and the air carried the scent of grilled sausage and cheap red wine. This was supposed to be an easy afternoon belonging to the working class.\n\nUntil a suppressed sob came from a corner of the crowd.\n\nIt was Marcel, an old workmate who had spent twenty years in the stamping workshop. He was surrounded by a few friends, his face as pale as theirs. Just yesterday, he was fired. The reason wasn't slowdown or error, but a word he didn't understand—'Job Optimization.' The newly appointed young factory director, a graduate of a Jacobin-led technical school, patted his shoulder and said that according to the latest efficiency evaluation model, his and another comrade's work could be done by one person, and his 'labor-output ratio' was slightly lower.\n\n'He calls it 'redundant manpower clearance,' Marcel's voice was trembling as he tightly gripped the faded CGT membership booklet, 'I shed blood for the revolution, I paid every cent of dues on time... I thought... I thought we were safe.'\n\nThat word spread through the picnic crowd like a virus. 'Redundancy,' 'Optimization,' 'Efficiency.' The accordion music stopped at some point, and the laughter vanished. All eyes turned toward Marcel, living proof of being abandoned by the new era. People's faces were filled with shock and panic. They suddenly realized that the red booklet they had regarded as an 'iron rice bowl' had seemingly rusted overnight. If an old comrade like Marcel could be discarded as easily as a scrap part, who would be next?\n\nThe picnic ended in a sour dispersal, replaced by a spontaneous assembly by the river, filled with anxiety and anger."

In the past, that red membership booklet was our everything—it meant a stable job, prioritized housing allocation, and a bright future for our children. We were the masters of this nation, the cornerstone of the revolution. But now, cold words like 'efficiency' and 'competition' are like chisels, breaking our iron rice bowls. We are told this will be a 'fairer' future. But to us ordinary workers who are no longer young, have no specialized skills, and only know how to turn screws—fairness smells just like unemployment."
