  Cof_economy_detail1_key:0 "Many things cannot be resolved with a single revolutionary victory, especially the economy. Ruins and debris won't transform themselves into brand-new factories. Facing the war-torn old Republic, numerous economic factions all want to paint this blank parchment with their own colors. The highly autonomous local communes and the balanced power among political factions have meant that our economic model has never been settled during the revolutionary years. However, it's time to put an end to this question. Without a clear economic system, we cannot ensure our political achievements won't be taken by our enemies.\n§gEconomic Situation (Economic Vitality) reflects the overall level of our economy. The better the situation, the greater the effects we gain, and our people will more strongly support our leadership.§!\n"
  Cof_economy_detail2_key:0 "\n§gEconomic affairs representatives largely embody the people's will regarding economic matters. The economic reform policies they support are easily passed, but if reforms go against their will, setbacks are likely. Each faction also holds its own influence over the economy. While our economic reforms can weaken some factions, if we provoke those with great influence, they will certainly not give up easily.§!\n"
  Cof_economy_detail3_key:0 "\n§gEconomic models determine what kind of economic activities we can undertake. But economic activities also affect our economic model, and can even shift it from one to another. Whether we draw from multiple strengths or carry out resolute reforms, our ultimate goal remains economic growth. Different economic models grant us different bonuses and unlockable economic activities but also reduce support from other economic factions. However, as long as the people benefit from our reforms, they will willingly back us. Economic vitality affects the benefits brought by the economic model.§!"
  Cof_economy_detail4_key:0 "\n§gIndustrial level basically reflects a nation's economic capability. Indicators such as steel output, energy extraction, and power generation collectively reflect our basic industrial level, which forms the foundation for further economic development. Industry is not only about technology levels, but also human initiative plays a vital role. An excellent organizational model can make our industry achieve more than the sum of its parts. Machines can replace humans in many tasks, but human thought is irreplaceable. However, if our industry cannot be converted into what our people need, even the strongest industry is useless. We must face reality and build enough arms factories to protect our people from enemies trying to extinguish our revolutionary flame.\n§!"
  Cof_economy_detail5_key:0 "\n§gIf industry is the branches of the economy, agriculture is its roots. We must first solve the bread issue before ideals and future. France is an agricultural nation, with this land nurturing countless lives. Many people take their food for granted, unaware of how hard life in the fields is. We have long neglected agriculture, causing the originally silent rural people to raise their voices. The days of relying solely on the weather are gone. Mechanization can free more laborers from tedious and inefficient farm work. The chemical fertilizer industry will increase yields per acre. Our people will have more abundant food. But merely selling raw produce cannot bring farmers more benefits. Extending the industrial chain will benefit both farmers and our economy.\n"
  Cof_economy_detail6_key:0 "\n§gAs a nation, France's economic centers have always concentrated between a few large cities. This may be good for greedy merchants and corrupt aristocrats, but our people say no. Economic equality is not only an attitude but a pressing need. No one should live in suffering. Even though we have proclaimed the victory of the socialist revolution, the urban-rural wealth gap still reminds us that the struggle must continue.\nIndustrial and supply chains are important economic components, but due to our past chaotic economic attitudes, links between industries are not tight, causing much loss and wasted workers' efforts. Fortunately, our reforms can restore our fragmented industrial layout.\nMany economists view the economy as a static model, ignoring the winds of change. This is why feudalism was left behind by capitalism, and socialism must likewise leave capitalism behind. Innovation best showcases our socialist superiority: while capitalists chase profits, they miss what truly benefits humanity — and these things should come from us.§!"

  cofeconomy.1.desc:0 "The plan originally set for 1937 to coincide with the elections has been moved forward due to the early elections. Thus, the 1937 Five-Year Plan becomes the 1936 Five-Year Plan. Our economic affairs representative, [DEA_leader_loc], has submitted a draft economic plan, reviewing the results of the past four years and outlining the direction for future reforms.\n\nHowever, when [CCSP_leader_loc] reviewed the current state of the Commune's economy, despite prior preparation, there was some surprise: the previous syndicalist economic reforms failed to show sufficient results and were often obstructed by local opposition to the General Confederation of Labour. In 1932, the once chaotic Commune economy seemed to show signs of unity, but now that appears to have been a fleeting illusion. The future of the Commune's economy seems difficult to decide within this single Five-Year period."

  cofeconomy.2.desc:0 "On May 13, 1934, Lucien Martin and Henry Torrès emerged from the courthouse defeated, facing the restless crowd. The next day, newspapers across the city blared the headline: "Lucien Martin Loses Lawsuit Against the General Confederation of Labour." Three days later, the Federal Anarchist Association declared it could no longer tolerate the bureaucratic style of the Comité Syndical Révolutionnaire and the CGT, withdrawing from the ruling coalition. The Parti Socialiste de France's newspaper, L'Avant Travailleur, openly questioned the ruling status of the syndicalists.\n\nFive days later, dissatisfied crowds took to the streets in protest. Monatte, then Chairman of the Labour Congress, and Pivert, Chair of the Public Safety Committee, successfully quelled the unrest and kept the government functioning. But one year later, on May 13, crowds again took to the streets, demanding reform of the CGT, a retrial for Martin, and the dismissal of implicated CGT members. This protest ended with Martin receiving extraordinary compensation beyond legal norms.\n\nToday, on May 13, 1936, the people once again march in support of Martin and countless workers who suffered similar fates. Having witnessed the chaos of prior marches, this time the protests are peaceful. Perhaps with the new election, hope has returned: beginning reform of the CGT, advancing towards economic reform."

  cofeconomy.3.title:0 "The Misfortune of a Worker"
  cofeconomy.3.desc:0 "In early spring 1934, Lucien Martin, a common worker at a small machinery factory in the Paris suburbs, saw his life shattered by an accident. Martin was a diligent and somewhat introverted middle-aged man who hadn't joined any union—not out of political opposition nor indifference to the revolution, but because he believed that as an independent worker, he could still contribute to the Commune's construction. He trusted that revolutionary France would protect every citizen.\n\nHowever, due to management negligence and aging equipment, an accident severely injured his arm, permanently preventing him from doing heavy physical labor. According to Commune labor laws, the factory should have covered his medical expenses and provided compensation. Yet, the factory's union committee, dominated by CGT members, gave only a meager condolence payment, dismissing all his further appeals on the grounds that Martin was not a registered union member nor had contributed to the union solidarity fund.\n\nFor Martin, this was not just economic despair but a collapse of belief. Attempts to seek justice through the local labor arbitration committee failed as it too was staffed by CGT representatives. His case was rejected before any formal hearing, with the rationale: "Citizen, the CGT protects workers. If you choose to remain outside this collective, you cannot fully enjoy the protections it offers.""
  cofeconomy.3.a:0 "If the revolution does not bring liberation, then what does it bring?"

  cofeconomy.4.title:0 "Opposition Voices"
  cofeconomy.4.desc:0 "Martin's plight quietly spread among his community and some small, independent worker groups. At first, it was just private complaints from those marginalized by the CGT's vast system. Soon, however, the 'Programists' noticed the case. To them, Martin's situation perfectly exposed the bureaucratic ossification and privilege under syndicalist rule — an organization meant to represent all workers had become a vast interest group serving only its own members, even becoming a new oppressor.\n\nAnarchist newspapers led by Le Libertaire began covering the issue, using the 'Lucien Martin Case' as a symbol to attack the CGT's monopoly. The articles caused uproar, especially among non-CGT workers and discontented intellectuals. Yet faced with the syndicalists' dominant propaganda machine, these voices initially remained weak.\n\nThrough anarchist activists' efforts, the case was entrusted to Henry Torrès, France's most renowned lawyer. Torrès was not only a legal giant but also a member of the Communist Party. A frequent contributor to L'Humanité and close friend of party leader Marcel Cachin, Torrès transcended partisan lines on principle, despising bureaucratic rigidity and sympathizing with anarchist ideals of individual freedom. This made him a trusted bridge between anarchists and communists alike. Both Cachin and Torrès knew that though the case originated from anarchists, it was a prime opportunity to strike at their common political opponent — the syndicalist establishment."

  cofeconomy.5.title:0 "A Failed Verdict, a Political Victory"
  cofeconomy.5.desc:0 "Torrès was outraged by the blatant injustice in the case. He declared he would represent Lucien Martin pro bono. He issued a public statement: "I am defending not just one man, but the principles of the revolution. If the Commune's laws cannot protect the most ordinary workers like Mr. Martin, then whom do they protect? Does this red flag truly fly for all the people, or only for certain organizations' members?"\n\nTorrès's involvement instantly transformed the lawsuit from a local labor dispute into a nationwide political trial. Inside and outside the courtroom, the streets emptied. With unparalleled eloquence, Torrès tore apart the CGT's legal team. He did not dwell on technical legalities but directly targeted the system itself. He challenged the court and all France: must a worker join a specific organization to be recognized as a "real worker"? Has the union's power grown so vast as to replace the law of the land?\n\nThe final verdict was no surprise. The court dismissed Martin's appeal, citing "no wrongdoing in the arbitration committee's decision under existing union regulations." Legally, Henry Torrès lost. But politically, he won a sweeping victory. The verdict sparked an uproar throughout the Commune. This failed trial ironically proved beyond dispute that the CGT's power had indeed surpassed the law. It confirmed all opposition claims and deeply wounded ordinary people who held pure ideals for the revolution."

  cofeconomy.6.title:0 "Journey to Bordeaux"
  cofeconomy.6.desc:0 ""So clean," Jacques marveled as they first walked Bordeaux's streets. Every brick perfectly aligned, trams glided quietly with a gentle hum. The buildings stood as if measured by a ruler, and even the pedestrians' steps had a determined energy. To Jacques, it felt like a finely maintained, massive engine, full of strength and efficiency.\n\nThey entered a "Commune Store," and Jacques was immediately drawn to the shelves filled with a dazzling array of goods—canned food, bread, cloth, tools—all well stocked, neatly categorized, and clearly priced on small blackboards. Excitedly, he told Marie, "This is what socialism should look like! No shortages, no chaos, everyone gets what they need."\n\nHowever, when Marie eagerly tried to buy a bottle of local wine for their honeymoon, they ran into trouble. The clerk politely declined their Paris francs, explaining the store accepted only "Bordeaux Labor Vouchers." To get the wine, they scoured half the city, finally exchanging for some crumpled tickets from a shady-looking black-market dealer at a poor rate.\n\nJacques's frustration quickly melted away that evening at the "Commune Canteen." In the spacious, bright hall, hundreds of comrades shared a hearty meal. The air buzzed with a warm, familial atmosphere. A talkative foreman approached Jacques, eagerly describing Bordeaux's industrial achievements and inviting him to join a production seminar after dinner. Jacques felt a profound sense of belonging, realizing this was the true meaning of "comrade"—a united, struggling family.\n\nMarie, however, seemed uneasy. She sipped the richly flavored wine bought with labor vouchers but couldn't take her eyes off the collective faces around her. Quietly, she told Jacques, "The people here are friendly, but… I feel like an intruder. I can't even find a place where just the two of us can talk quietly. Our honeymoon feels like part of a collective event."\n\nJacques was stunned. Seeing the slight, unhidden sadness in Marie's eyes and the collective joy surrounding them, he for the first time questioned the cost of this "perfect order.""
  cofeconomy.6.a:0 ""Maybe… this is the future, Marie. A strong, unified France.""
  cofeconomy.6.b:0 ""But is this really the future we want, Jacques?""

  cofeconomy.7.title:0 "Journey to Calais"
  cofeconomy.7.desc:0 "From the moment Marie set foot on Calais soil, she felt like a fish back in water.\n\nThe air was a mix of salty sea, faint coal smoke bitterness, and the clamor of people. Unlike Bordeaux's silence, here was a lively, slightly chaotic freedom. Marie pulled Jacques excitedly through crowds of varied skin tones and accents. She bought two tickets to the latest theater from a British sailor in fluent English and found a delicate shell-made brooch at an open-air market.\n\n"Here, I feel like an individual, not just a part of a collective," Marie told Jacques, her eyes shining. They entered a small secondhand bookstore where the bespectacled old owner leisurely drank tea. Marie bought an old edition of Baudelaire's poems with Paris francs; the owner smiled, giving change without asking where she came from.\n\nHer favorite experience was a craft workshop. She admired a beautiful candle holder made from colorful glass shards, but the young female artist said, "I don't take money here, comrade. But I need help handing out new leaflets to dockworkers. Would you trade your labor for mine?"\n\nMarie happily agreed. She spent an afternoon chatting and distributing flyers calling for "Workers of the world, unite!" at the docks. Returning to the hotel with the unique candle holder, she felt unprecedented fulfillment. It was a voluntary, equal, mutual exchange—the social relation she longed for.\n\nJacques, however, saw another side. He saw unplanned cargo handling and rival union groups undercutting each other to win jobs. He saw a drunken sailor harassing passersby, with no "Public Safety comrades" intervening. "It's too chaotic here, Marie," he said one night. "Freedom is great, but freedom without order just leads to the strong exploiting the weak. How is this different from the old world?"\n\nMarie didn't argue. She just watched the flickering flame on the candle holder and softly said, "Maybe. But at least here, I feel like I can breathe.""
  cofeconomy.7.a:0 ""I love the freedom here, Jacques. It's imperfect, but it's real.""
  cofeconomy.7.b:0 ""I only see chaos, Marie. A beautiful but dangerous chaos.""

  cofeconomy.8.title:0 "Journey to Marseille"
  cofeconomy.8.desc:0 "If Bordeaux was a precise machine and Calais a free beach, Marseille was a volcano erupting.\n\nJacques was immediately captivated by the city's passion. Bold futurist graffiti covered the streets; the air brimmed with a spicy, vibrant energy. People seemed inexhaustible—not just working, but 'fighting.' Jacques witnessed port cranes swinging precisely and powerfully like giant arms, accompanied by workers' loud songs.\n\nThe order here was an inner discipline fueled by passion. One afternoon, they visited a "vanguard theater troupe" of dockworkers. In an abandoned shipyard, workers performed a modern dance about revolution and sacrifice using searchlights and metallic percussion. The raw, unfiltered power thrilled Jacques. "This is revolution!" he exclaimed to Marie. "Not empty talks in parliament, but power from the heart!"\n\nHe even arm-wrestled with veteran fighters at a "workers' club," drinking cheap but strong aniseed liquor. Though he lost badly, he laughed with pure joy. He felt part of a true "brotherhood," finding the pure comradeship lost in Paris offices.\n\nMarie, however, remained an outsider. She admired the art but felt uneasy with the pervasive collectivism. When she tried to quietly read in a café, a group of enthusiastic youths invited her to join their "philosophy debate group" on "myth in the post-revolution era." She politely declined but sensed a hint of confusion and disappointment in their eyes.\n\n"Everything here has a purpose, Jacques," she whispered in the hotel. "Art is propaganda, debates unify thought, even drinking strengthens battle bonds. I can't find any space that exists purely for 'the individual.'"\n\nJacques wanted to argue but didn't know how. He loved the city's power and purpose, but Marie's words awakened him. Was this organized passion also a suppression of individual will? When everyone marches toward the same 'myth,' what happens to those who refuse the path?\n\nOn departure day, Jacques gazed at the giant slogan on the station wall—'Workers, State, Revolution'—feeling complex emotions. He longed for the power but feared what it might become if unleashed."
  cofeconomy.8.a:0 ""But don't you think, Marie? They truly believe in what they do!""
  cofeconomy.8.b:0 ""That's exactly what I fear, Jacques. When people believe in only one thing.""

  cofeconomy.9.title:0 "Back in Paris"
  cofeconomy.9.desc:0 "Back in their familiar Paris apartment, the view outside the window remained the same, but Jacques and Marie's inner worlds could never return to what they were.\n\nJacques threw himself back into daily union work. He used to get frustrated by inefficiencies and complain about cumbersome approval processes. But now, when he saw colleagues fiercely arguing over the specifications of a single screw, he thought of Bordeaux's precise, efficient social machine. Maybe a bit of "order" wasn't such a bad thing. Yet, when he saw the CGT leadership once again using privileges to benefit their own factions, he remembered the free and fair exchanges of Calais, and Proudhon's ideals.\n\nMarie buried herself in preparing for the bar exam. The heavy Commune Federal Civil Code exhausted her. She wished the law were as clear and efficient as Bordeaux's technocrats designed it to be. But reading clauses about union privileges reminded her of Lucien Martin from the "CGT lawsuit," the ordinary man crushed mercilessly by the system. She began to question the meaning of a law that doesn't protect the individual, no matter how "efficient" it may be.\n\nTheir conversations at the dinner table became richer and heavier than ever.\n\n"The people of Bordeaux look prosperous," Jacques would say, "At least they don't worry about making ends meet."\n\n"But at the cost of their personal choices, Jacques," Marie would counter, "Like in Calais, where it's chaotic but at least everyone is free."\n\n"But Calais' freedom feels too cold," Jacques sighed, "I prefer Marseille's… passion. Though that passion is frightening."\n\nFor the first time, they realized the word "socialism" had so many different faces on French soil. Order and chaos, collective and individual, efficiency and freedom, myth and reality. These once abstract philosophical concepts had become concrete feelings from their travels.\n\nOne night, walking along the Seine, gazing at the familiar Parisian nightscape, they still loved the city—its freedom and prosperity—but their love now carried a complex reflection. The trips to Bordeaux, Calais, and Marseille were like three prisms, refracting different sides of Parisian daily life and revealing their inner confusion.\n\nNo place was a perfect utopia. Life was always about seeking balance. And their nation, their Commune, seemed poised on a precarious tipping point."
  cofeconomy.9.a:0 ""Perhaps," Marie whispered, "the question isn't which place is better, but whether we can find a path that works for everyone.""
  cofeconomy.9.b:0 "Jacques said nothing. He only felt that a storm of change was gathering over Paris."

  cofeconomy.10.title:0 "Us and Them"
  cofeconomy.10.desc:0 "The whistle signaling the end of the shift sounded, and Alain stepped out of the Renault factory gate with a steady, almost proud feeling. The radio's announcements about the CGT's expanding powers felt like a reassurance, filling him with confidence about the future. He decided to celebrate with a drink at the corner tavern.\n\nThe smoke-filled tavern was as usual. He spotted Julien, a neighbor living downstairs who worked at an independent print shop. Alain raised his glass and slapped Julien's shoulder warmly. "Julien! Come on, my treat! What a good day, isn't it?"\n\nJulien slowly lifted his head, his eyes devoid of the joy Alain expected, filled only with cold, distant fatigue. "Yeah, Alain," he said quietly, with a trace of sarcasm, "For you, it sure is."\n\nAlain frowned. "Us? Julien, what do you mean? Aren't we all comrades?"\n\nJulien laughed—a laugh colder than the tavern's chill. "Comrades? My shop is closing next week because of your new 'production qualification inspections.' My son wanted to be an apprentice but was turned away because he lacks that little red booklet. And you—you live in an apartment with a balcony, go to the seaside for holidays, and your kids have the best opportunities. Are we still comrades?" He leaned in, lowering his voice. Each word hammered into Alain's ears like nails: "You're not comrades, Alain. You're the new aristocracy. Wearing workers' clothes, speaking revolutionary words, but how different are you from those old regime folks?"\n\nThe word "aristocracy" struck Alain like lightning. It was the very term they once used for those sent to the guillotine. He opened his mouth but found no words. Several nearby tables fell silent, watching with complex expressions—sympathy, anger, schadenfreude. The drink in Alain's hand suddenly felt unbearably heavy. He put it down and stumbled out of the tavern. The Paris night wind blew on his face, and for the first time, he felt a biting cold. The solid fortress the union had built for him suddenly seemed like a cold, high wall—one that separated him from countless "comrades.""
  cofeconomy.10.a:0 "Who built this wall, after all?"

  cofeconomy.11.title:0 "The Price of Equality"
  cofeconomy.11.desc:0 "The aroma of stew filled Alain's apartment; his wife was busy in the kitchen, humming a new song from the radio. The announcer read the latest decree passed by the Labor General Council in a bland tone.\n\n"...aimed at breaking rigid economic structures... improving production flexibility... granting local cooperatives and non-union enterprises more autonomy... "\n\nAlain stopped polishing his tools. He didn't understand the words, but he understood their meaning. He pulled out his slightly worn CGT membership booklet. This little booklet meant more than a stable job. It meant priority access to this apartment with a balcony, unlike his non-union neighbor still cramped in a smaller, damper room. It meant his son could easily become an apprentice at the Pito armory with a bright future, rather than competing on "equal terms" for a spot at the textile mill. It meant yearly summer vacations at the CGT sanatorium on the Riviera, basking in two weeks of sun and sea breeze.\n\nHe had always taken these as his due rewards from the revolution for loyal pillars like himself.\n\nBut now, the state seemed to be redefining "reward." "Flexibility," "autonomy." These words felt like cold chisels knocking at the foundation of his comfortable life. He imagined the factory supervisor—the Jacobin always talking about "performance" and "efficiency"—with a satisfied smile. He saw a sign reading "job competition" next to his familiar lathe that had run for twenty years. He saw that spots at the sanatorium would now be "lottery-based," and his son's apprenticeship subject to "annual review."\n\nThe solid, smooth road paved by the union under his feet seemed to be flattening. The road remained, but it no longer belonged to him. Everyone was pushed onto the same starting line, and he was no longer young.\n\nA chill rose up his spine. What he was about to lose was not the bread itself, but the butter spread on it, the wine glass, the window overlooking the square.\n\nThe voice on the radio continued, but Alain no longer heard a thing."

  cofeconomy.12.title:0 "The Boiling Silence"
  cofeconomy.12.desc:0 "After a grandiose demonstration, Paris entered a strange calm. The Public Safety Committee issued a lengthy statement promising to "establish a cross-departmental special commission to comprehensively and cautiously study the role of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) in the Commune's economic and social structures."\n\nThis was a classic move to cool boiling public sentiment with time and bureaucracy.\n\nBut they were wrong.\n\nTo the opposition, this statement was not reassurance but provocation; not caution but cowardice. This silence became fertile ground for the wild growth of radical ideas.\n\nThe circulation of Le Libertaire doubled. Anarchists and communists whispered to every non-CGT worker, telling them that the so-called "special commission" was just a delaying lie; only thorough, grassroots transformation could bring true justice. In Belleville's worker canteens, debates about "class enemies within the working class" became public and fierce for the first time.\n\nJacobin newspapers packaged the government's hesitation as proof of the syndicalist system's inherent failure. They contrasted the clear production directives under the "Bordeaux model" with endless quarrels in the Paris parliament, silently shouting, "Look at this inefficient chaos! How much longer will you endure?" Technocrats and dissatisfied middle classes worshiped these papers in their clubs.\n\nAnd the most dangerous sparks were lit in the city's shadows. Sorelians distributed pamphlets at veterans' taverns and secret student meetings, proclaiming that government incompetence proved the Commune's spirit was rotten and weak. They spoke not of reform, but of "purification" and "rebirth." They said when a country is afraid to cut its own wounds, a sharper knife must come from outside to help.\n\nThis undercurrent soon turned from words to action. In Lyon, brawls erupted between CGT members and non-union workers at a silk factory; in Nantes, local cooperatives openly declared refusal to fulfill supply contracts with CGT-affiliated factories; in the army, debates over "loyalty to the Commune" versus "loyalty to the union" kept officers awake all night.\n\nThe government wanted silence, but what they got was the suffocating, boiling silence before a volcanic eruption. All of France had become a pressure cooker with the release valve firmly welded shut."
  cofeconomy.12.a:0 "A single match is all it takes to ignite the whole nation."

  cofeconomy.13.title:0 "The Machine's Dissonance"
  cofeconomy.13.desc:0 "Seventeen years after the revolution, the massive machine of the French Commune still runs. Chimneys billow smoke, trains race along tracks, and production figures climb year by year in the newspapers. Yet an unsettling dissonance grows louder from within the machine, seeping through every gear's crevice.\n\nAt first, this noise echoed only in Parisian cafés and university lecture halls. Editorials in L'Avant Ouvrier sharply dissected the 'Bordeaux model's' efficiency versus systemic chaos; Le Libertaire serialized in-depth reports on non-union workers' plight, questioning whether the revolution had birthed a new privileged class. These articles circulated among intellectuals and discontented groups like stones cast into a pond, stirring ever-widening ripples.\n\nSoon, the dissonance spread to streets and alleys. From Marseille's docks to Lyon's textile mills, workers complained of conflicting regulations among local Communes; farmers in Loire Valley vineyards muttered curses at grain procurement prices favoring urban interests. A bill of exchange sent from Calais to Bordeaux might shrink in value en route due to differing local laws. 'One France, a thousand economies,' a popular sardonic phrase, was becoming undeniable reality.\n\nThe anniversary march of the 'CGT lawsuit' became the fuse that ignited all grievances. This time, protesters included not only anarchists and communists but also Jacobins carrying banners for 'order and efficiency' and Sorelian veterans shouting slogans for 'national unity.' The once seemingly unbreakable syndicalist consensus was being torn apart by centrifugal forces of reality. The Labor General Council plunged into endless disputes, and Public Safety Committee orders met local resistance at every turn.\n\nThis machine could no longer pretend all was well. Calls for a thorough, unified economic reform swelled from whispers into a deafening torrent. It demanded an answer — a final decision on France's future direction."

  Cof_call_for_economic_reform_desc:0 "In the past, many of our economic problems were intentionally or unintentionally overlooked under the veil of rapid growth during economic reconstruction. The 1925 reforms on currency and finance were an attempt to unify the fragmented Commune economy, but concessions made by the Revolutionary Workers' Committee to the United Allied Syndicates for the 1927 elections once again dispersed economic control.\n\nThe '1925 economic system' represents the political pattern following the first large-scale economic reform and the compromise with the anarchists: local authorities hold economic power, while the Public Safety Committee under the Revolutionary Workers' Committee exerts limited influence to regulate regional economic development. This model has persisted until today. Although after the 1934 'CGT lawsuit,' local economic authority increased due to controversy surrounding the Revolutionary Workers' Committee, the '1925 economic system' is still officially considered the Commune's prevailing economic model.\n\nAfter Black Monday's outbreak, as a socialist state, we should have welcomed it. Instead, voices of opposition grew louder. Especially after the anniversary march of the 'CGT lawsuit,' calls for economic reform intensified. Not only factions opposing syndicalism but even syndicalists themselves began radicalizing, seeking a truly syndicalist economic model. Yet all factions and viewpoints understand the people's call for a unified economic system — no one wants to relearn local economic rules every time they travel or work elsewhere."

  cofeconomy.14.desc:0 "Morning at the port of Marseille should have been filled with the chorus of cranes and the blasts of whistles. But today, the harbor was shrouded in an eerie, restless silence.\n\nAndré Bertrand, chairman of Marseille's Labor Committee and a lifelong syndicalist under the CGT banner, stood by his office window, frowning deeply. The telegraphs in his hand had piled into a thick stack, each one a heavy anchor.\n\nTelegrams from Lyon's silk mills pleaded urgently for high-quality long-staple cotton from Egypt, but the cargo ships had been stalled in the Mediterranean for a week; their captains reported no bank had issued letters of credit to pay port fees. Telegrams from the Pito armory requested special steel from neutral Sweden, but the German shipping company responsible suddenly went bankrupt overnight, leaving the shipments stranded in an unknown Baltic port. Worst of all, telegrams from the Renault factory warned that their last batch of South American rubber for production lines would last only three more days.\n\n'Red economic zone'? 'Independent autonomy'? André smiled bitterly. Only now did he realize that their so-called independence rested on a global machine composed of countless invisible capitalist gears. Proudly refusing to participate in that financial gamble, they had not anticipated the whole casino shutting down when the table was overturned.\n\nThe phone rang sharply. It was Paris, the Economic Affairs Office. The young, anxious voice on the other end inquired why so many tractors and cloths ready for export piled up at the port. André wearily cut him off: 'Comrade, the problem isn't that our goods can't be sold. The problem is that others' goods can't come in. Without rubber, how can tractors have tires? Without dye, cloth is just a pile of white fabric!'\n\nA long silence followed. André knew that, like him, the caller had seen the terrifying truth: the great industrial machine of the French Commune, though not collapsing like Berlin's casino, was rapidly clogging its veins due to lack of vital external resources. The machine was about to fall silent.\n\nThis crisis was unlike any they had anticipated. It was not financial, nor demand-driven — it was physical, about the real screws, cotton, and rubber that should have crossed oceans to reach them."

We were not directly struck by the towering waves it unleashed, but choked by the pandemics it spread.\n\nOur revolutionary machine needs real sustenance to operate — oil, rubber, and rare minerals from neutral countries. Pragmatically, we traded with the despised capitalist world, using its resources as the foundation for our construction. But now that world has fallen into madness and paralysis, and the global trade lifeline we depend on is breaking apart before our eyes. Ships stranded in distant ports, letters of credit reduced to worthless paper, factories facing silence for lack of basic raw materials.\n\nThis is a crisis our theorists never predicted: a material crisis, not a capital one.\n\nOpponents swarm like flies sensing blood, screaming this is the inevitable consequence of our 'degenerate' dealings with capitalism. They would rather have the people embrace an idealistic poverty for ideological 'purity.' But they forget, without the trade they despise, the ones paying the price for that 'purity' are our people.\n\nStocks are running dangerously low.

Our world, this great order built on gold, steel, and free markets, was trembling like a house of cards in the storm of 'Black Monday.' Our people were starving, our machines rusting.\n\nAt this desperate moment, a telegram arrived from the most unlikely place—Paris, the very hotbed of the red revolution.\n\nThe French Commune, our implacable enemy, had extended an 'olive branch.' Their tone was polite but laced with condescension. They claimed their economy, thanks to the 'superior socialist system,' had been spared the financial collapse and their factories were still running at full speed. Now, 'in a humanitarian spirit,' they were willing to engage in 'pragmatic cooperation' with us.\n\nThis was a naked deal, a pact with the devil. They offered urgently needed industrial goods—machine tools, tractors, medicines, even some consumer products—to help stabilize our society on the brink of collapse. In exchange, they demanded access to our (or our sphere's) natural resources—oil, rubber, grain… and our precious gold reserves.\n\nThe cabinet chamber echoed with furious arguments. Military leaders and conservative elders were outraged, seeing this as the most vicious insult to our national dignity—a foolish act of financing the enemy to strangle ourselves. Yet the economy minister and industrialists worried aloud: without these supplies, we might not survive the winter. Riots could spiral into revolution; we could perish in our own civil strife.\n\nThe weight of choice rested on our shoulders. To uphold ideological purity and dignity, or to swallow this poisoned chalice from the enemy for the sake of survival?"

  cofeconomy.16.desc:0 "The silence at the port lingered; the cold touch of machines cooling from lack of materials still lingered on fingertips. We all had felt the helplessness of the chain linking us to the world breaking. We thought we were an independent continent, only to discover we were but an island adrift in an ocean.\n\nBut now, a telegram came from Paris via the Third International's red communication network, like a lightning bolt piercing the fog. It brought not condolences but a blueprint—a grand vision to build a new world atop the ruins of the old.\n\nThe comrades in Paris declared they had found an answer in this crisis. They called it the 'Self-Sufficiency Plan'—a bold gamble waging war on nature itself, to squeeze fuel from coal, to cultivate rubber in labs, a genesis act.\n\nBut that was not the whole story. The second half of the telegram revealed their true ambition. They proposed to expand this internal French revolution into a shared cause of the entire Third International. They invited us, and all core comrades, to jointly build a true 'Red Economic Circle'—a completely self-contained red fortress connected by our own fleets, coordinated by our own plans, supplied by our own resources.\n\nThey were willing to share everything: from synthetic fuel chemical formulas to modern greenhouse blueprints. What they offered was no charity, but an invitation to build together. This was a historic choice—to join this Paris-led grand plan filled with hope and uncertainty, or to find our own ark alone amid the global storm."

  cofeconomy.17.desc:0 "The union branch at the Renault factory organized a weekend picnic by the Marne River. The accordion played cheerful tunes, children chased each other on the grass, and the air was filled with the scent of grilled sausages and cheap red wine. It should have been a leisurely afternoon for the working class.\n\nUntil a stifled sob came from the crowd's corner.\n\nIt was Marcel, an old worker who had spent twenty years in the stamping workshop. A few friends surrounded him, their faces as pale as his. Just yesterday, he had been laid off—not for slacking, not for mistakes, but for a word he didn't understand: 'position optimization.' The newly appointed young factory manager, a graduate from a Jacobin-led technical school, patted his shoulder and said that according to the latest efficiency evaluation model, he and another comrade's work could be done by one person, and his 'labor output ratio' was slightly lower.\n\n'He calls it "redundant labor clearance,"' Marcel's voice trembled as he tightly gripped his faded CGT membership handbook. 'I bled for the revolution, paid every union fee on time... I thought... I thought we were safe.'\n\nThat word spread like a virus among the picnic attendees: 'redundant,' 'optimization,' 'efficiency.' The accordion stopped playing, laughter vanished. All eyes turned to Marcel—the living proof discarded by the new era. Faces showed shock and panic. They suddenly realized the once 'iron rice bowl' red handbook had rusted overnight. If even old comrades like Marcel could be tossed aside like obsolete parts, who would be next?\n\nThe picnic ended uneasily, replaced by a spontaneous, anxious, and angry gathering by the river."

That red membership handbook was everything—it meant steady work, priority housing, bright futures for our children. We were masters of this country, the foundation of the revolution. But now, cold words like 'efficiency' and 'competition' are chiseling away at our iron rice bowls. We are told this will be a 'fairer' future. But for us ordinary workers who are no longer young, have no special skills, and only know how to tighten screws, fairness smells like unemployment.'"
