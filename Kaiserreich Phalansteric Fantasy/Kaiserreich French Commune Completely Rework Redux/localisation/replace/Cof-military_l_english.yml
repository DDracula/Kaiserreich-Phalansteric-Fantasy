  Cof_militray_reform_detail1_key:0 "The Federal Army played a crucial role in defending the revolution, but in this era of change, various ideological currents have stirred within the ranks. Since the Great War, popular enthusiasm for war has steadily waned, and to replenish the army’s ranks, most recruits are unskilled 're-employment personnel.' Undoubtedly, these individuals cannot uphold the banner of the Commune’s army, making military reform imperative. However, military reform inevitably affects our society, and views on the army vary widely. Some even see our army as a 'remnant of oppression,' advocating for its complete dissolution and entrusting the nation’s security to fragile militia units.\n\nEven within the army, attitudes toward the Commune’s politics differ. Since the Chief of Staff is an elected position with significant influence over the entire military system, it is difficult to ensure the army functions solely as a force defending the revolution without involvement in other social spheres. In the worst case, our reform plans might even be rejected by the army itself.\n"
  Cof_militray_reform_detail2_key:0 "§g$class_pop_officers$ are senior members of the army, wielding considerable influence within the strict hierarchical system where subordinates obey superiors. Typically composed of older veterans, this group also includes some theoretical commanders who have never seen the front lines. Thanks to their knowledge and experience, they can devise detailed plans and predict battle developments through simulations.\n§!"
  Cof_militray_reform_detail3_key:0 "§g$class_pop_ncos$ form the army’s middle management, mostly promoted from the rank-and-file $class_pop_soldiers$. They possess frontline combat experience as well as some theoretical knowledge.

  Cof_militray_reform_detail4_key:0 "§g$class_pop_soldiers$ are the fundamental units of the army, tasked with obeying and executing orders. However, after our revolution, a growing sentiment argues that this strict chain of command is a form of class oppression. $class_pop_soldiers$ are neither thoughtless machines nor disposable pawns. If not for the $class_pop_soldiers$ who defied the Old Republic’s orders, our revolution would not have succeeded.\n§!"
  Cof_militray_reform_detail5_key:0 "\n§gNo one can predict the exact direction of future warfare, but tactical discussions continue. Due to the Commune’s strong political atmosphere, these debates have split into factions based on political alignments.
