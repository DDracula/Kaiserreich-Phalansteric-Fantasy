  Cof_military_reform_desc_true:0 "The Federal Army played a vital role in defending the revolution, but in an era of change, various ideological currents within the military are stirring. Since the Great War, public enthusiasm for conflict has waned, and to replenish the army's ranks, many recruits are unskilled 're-employment' personnel. Unquestionably, these individuals cannot shoulder the mantle of the Communal Army; reform is imperative. However, military reform will inevitably affect our society. Views on the army vary—some groups even view it as a 'vestige of oppression' and advocate for its total disbandment, entrusting national security to fragile militia forces.\n\nWhether the army belongs to the nation or a specific political faction cannot be decided by a mere sentence in the constitution. An army detached from politics might ensure regime stability, but as the embodiment of state will, it is the one force that can least afford to be apolitical. If our revolution faces internal crisis, the army is the force we must rely on.\n§R(Note: The direction of military reform is closely linked to the choice of military doctrine. Choosing a doctrine that contradicts your reforms may lead to chaos within the ranks!)§!"
