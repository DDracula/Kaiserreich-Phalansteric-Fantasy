  Cof_politics:0 "Commune Politics"
  Cof_politics_detail1_key:0 "§gThe Constitution of 1921 declares that the French Commune is a federal syndicalist-socialist republic composed of over 36,000 communes. Its highest legislative body is the §YBourse Générale du Travail (BGT)§!, which handles legislation. The §YDraft for National Economic Reconstruction and Defense of the Revolution§! establishes that the §YComité de Salut Public (CSP)§! is the organ responsible for executing the will of the people.\n\nThe §YBGT§! is composed of 650 representatives from local communes. All proposals must pass a vote in the §YBGT§!, requiring at least 326 votes (50% + 1) to be approved. In theory, the §YBGT§! has the authority to dissolve the §YCSP§!, and in the past, motions to do so have been proposed—none have passed.\n\nThe §YCSP§!, though originally a "temporary" executive body, maintains independence from the §YBGT§! through a vertically managed system.

Overtime, wage theft, and intrusion into private life all reveal the truth: under capitalism, the eight-hour day is another tool of exploitation, dressed up in socialist garb.\n\nContrary to claims that it encourages 'laziness,' the eight-hour day in fact unleashes productivity greater than that under ten or more hours of toil. It grants workers ample leisure time to pursue personal interests and acquire knowledge—raising the overall quality of our citizenry.§!"

  cofpolitics.1.title:0 "The Political Situation in France"
  cofpolitics.1.desc:0 "The dual system of the Bourse Générale du Travail (BGT) and the Comité de Salut Public (CSP), instituted by the French Commune, has always faced the test of practical governance. Although the original federal design—separating legislative and executive powers—was broadly accepted at the Commune's founding, its idealistic architecture has revealed several flaws in practice.\n\nThe CSP operates under a system of direct nationwide elections, with departments divided by function and seats distributed proportionally. The leading political faction in each field holds the corresponding position. In contrast, the BGT is structured as a multi-tiered delegate system, with representatives elected upward from local assemblies—essentially a conglomeration of local interests at the federal level. While the President of the BGT also serves as the President of the Commune, the CSP Chair wields far greater actual authority, even though the BGT holds constitutional precedence.\n\nEach federated commune also implements a similar dual system at the local level. As a result, dominant local factions often control both the local council and its executive committee. Although these local CSP branches are nominally subordinate to the central CSP, in practice, the latter lacks effective means of enforcing compliance. The BGT fares even worse—it holds no influence over local councils and cannot interfere in their legislative processes. Its authority remains confined strictly to the federal tier.\n\nThis territorial grounding of delegates is particularly evident in regions such as Paris, Bordeaux, Calais, and Marseille, where political affiliations are pronounced. Even nominally independent delegates from these areas often align closely with local dominant factions. In other regions, delegates tend to shift positions based on specific policy debates. Political analysts often categorize delegates based on their voting patterns, but these labels oversimplify the fluid dynamics of factional bargaining—and rarely reflect lifelong loyalty."

  cofpolitics.2.desc:0 "Often regarded as the 'orthodox' faction, the Syndicalists have consistently adhered to the ideological tenets of syndicalism—despite significant internal differences. As the longest-ruling faction of the Commune, they are widely viewed as the establishment's foundation. Rather than reshaping the structure of the Federation, the Syndicalists have focused on maintaining stability and continuing along the syndicalist path.\n\nHistorically, they maintained close cooperation with the Anarchists, due to ideological overlap. In the early days, this relationship was smooth—but once the Syndicalists gained full control of the state apparatus, a number of 'pure anarchists' grew disillusioned with what they saw as creeping bureaucratism and splintered off to form the 'Programmatists', a strictly anarchist political group. Nevertheless, this did not entirely sever ties between the Syndicalists and Anarchists, who remained allies until 1934.\n\nThe 1934 'CGT Trial' was catastrophic, nearly ending the Syndicalist 'dynasty.' The Anarchists broke decisively with the Syndicalists, and only a few right-wing anarchists sympathetic to the establishment remained. Though then-CSP Chair Marceau Pivert managed to keep the administration intact, public support for the Syndicalists began to fracture.\n\nWithin the party, the trial ignited a fierce internal debate. The Moderate faction, branded as 'bureaucrats' by critics, argued for reform and stabilization. In contrast, the Radicals—dismissed as 'madmen'—demanded that the CGT be defended and purified rather than sacrificed for political convenience."

To them, unions are rooted in their respective industries—a coal plant's union is inherently different from that of a textile mill. The CGT, which connects these disparate sectors, has evolved into a 'state within a state.'\n\nFollowing the revolution, the CGT's economic dominance and the Syndicalists' institutional grip gave rise to what critics label a 'bureaucratic machine'—a term the Moderates would reject. To them, this is a natural and desirable evolution of syndicalism. They admit the CGT has problems, but believe radical action would do more harm than good. Gradual reform is acceptable—but undermining the CGT's political and economic role is not.\n\nThe Moderates strive to maintain the Syndicalist 'big tent,' but the CGT Trial shattered their alliance with the Anarchists and symbolized the collapse of that strategy. Nevertheless, for these pragmatic leaders, compromise is part of politics. Though dismissed by Radicals as 'traitors to syndicalism,' they believe themselves to be the responsible stewards of the revolution."

The Radicals identify with 'Solidarity Unionism,' a movement inspired by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the United States.\n\nThey fiercely oppose the CGT's bureaucratic tendencies and seek to dismantle the 'medieval guild model' of industrial unionism. They argue for transferring real power to the base—ordinary workers on the shop floor—rather than upholding hierarchical structures. Moreover, they have lost all patience with the squabbling between local councils and the CGT. Since the CGT functions as a 'state within a state,' the Radicals propose openly declaring it the real governing institution, allowing workers to directly manage legislation and administration.\n\nWhile their positions isolate them from other factions, the Radicals are far from marginal. They enjoy strong support among urban workers, and even some right-wing anarchists—convinced by Solidarity Unionism—have come to see them as the true heirs of anarcho-syndicalist ideals."

Despite internal differences, their mutual disdain for both the Syndicalist establishment and the 'Opposition Bloc' (the Jacobins and Sorelians) drew them together.

Recognizing the limitations of Leninism within the Commune's unique system and their weak parliamentary presence, the Communists have abandoned both hardline revolutionary confrontation and passive reformism. Instead, they seek a democratic Commune-state modeled on the ideals of Marx and Engels. That said, the party's left wing—figures like Boris Souvarine—still embrace proletarian dictatorship, which they reconcile with the Commune's democratic structure.\n\nThe PCUT's base lies with marginalized workers and the long-neglected rural population. Although traditionally Marxist parties oppose religion, France's peasantry remains devoutly Catholic. To court their support, the Communists avoid public attacks on religion and even adopt an ambiguous stance—neither endorsing nor condemning it."

Witnessing this betrayal, a small faction of 'pure anarchists'—the 'Programmatists'—split off, while most anarchists still harbored illusions about the Syndicalist establishment. It was only after the 'CGT Trial' that the Anarchists realized the Syndicalists had abandoned any genuine 'Anarcho-Syndicalist' path long ago. Ultimately, they rejected the Moderates' attempts at reconciliation and struck out as an independent political force.\n\nAfter their split, the Programmatists—once considered traitors—returned to the Association des Fédéralistes Anarchistes, reforming the organization based on their grassroots experiences. Though independent, the Anarchists remain a notable faction but lack the strength to confront the Syndicalists alone. The authoritarian nature of the 'Opposition Bloc' also precludes collaboration.

This was because early political conditions did not yet foster the kind of demands that would produce a Jacobin movement. However, as the revolution stabilized and the economy began to recover, the former radical liberals and the growing middle class realized they had no real voice in Commune politics.\n\nMarcel Déat was a prominent example. Formerly a member of the SFIO and a sympathizer of Jean Jaurès, he found syndicalist ideology ill-suited to the post-revolution social realities. Déat began rethinking socialism, eventually meeting Adrien Marquet in Bordeaux. Together, in 1930, they published the 'New Socialist Manifesto' and founded the Parti Socialiste de France. The New Socialists advocated a more centralized political and economic model, and in the following year absorbed the French People's Party, which had reformed after being expelled from the Communist Party.\n\nInfluenced by Leninism and Radical Republicanism, the New Socialists favored planned economy models and revolutionary authoritarianism akin to the Montagnards. Initially, 'Jacobin' was a derogatory label used by opponents against the Parti Socialiste de France, but Déat embraced it, often publicly calling himself a Jacobin. Undoubtedly, the discontent of intellectuals and the middle class over their lack of influence fueled the rise of the Jacobins."

Instead, they focus on reforming the Comité de Salut Public, openly calling to transform it into an almost dictatorial body, relegating the BGT to a subsidiary role.\n\nThough this frank call for dictatorship met strong opposition from the Opposition Bloc, their technocratic model found support among many middle-class and bureaucratic elements.

Early on, Doriot had proposed reconciling with reformists and absorbing them, but was expelled as a 'social chauvinist'; Barbé, a former radical Leninist, was expelled as 'leftist' for advocating radical class struggle.\n\nDisillusioned, these former Communists sought a new revolutionary path rooted in French tradition, combining Saint-Simon's 'industrial state' socialism, Robespierre's revolutionary terror, Blanqui's secret society model, and some Marxist ideas—creating a 'French homegrown vanguardism.' The French People's Party was their political vehicle.\n\nIronically, after Doriot's expulsion, the Communist Party reconciled with centrists and reformists, reconstituting as the Worker-Peasant United Communist Party. Doriot, however, rejected reconciliation, choosing outright opposition and competing with the Communists for rural and non-CGT workers.\n\nYet the People's Party never gained the upper hand. After the New Socialist movement began, Doriot saw its potential and merged the People's Party into the Socialist Party in 1931. The New Socialists acted as theorists and elites, while the former People's Party grassroots enabled the Revolutionary Actionists to exist as an independent faction within the party.

At that time, the 'Sorelians' as a faction did not exist—in fact, the entire Syndicalist movement could be considered 'Sorelian.'\n\nHowever, after Sorel's death, comrades began dividing his political legacy, each vying to occupy his place. A series of political struggles led Sorel's close friend and war veteran Georges Valois to lead a faction of Sorel supporters to break away and form the 'National Syndicalist Alliance.' Having experienced the early turmoil, Valois claimed Sorel's later thought shifted toward advocating a more centralized post-revolution system. The myth of the general strike, he argued, was meant to overthrow the bourgeois republic, not build a socialist homeland.\n\nOther Sorel supporters, also splitting from the Syndicalists, rejected Valois's revisionist claims, preferring Sorel's youthful ideology and actively embracing futurism, surrealism, and other avant-garde cultural movements.

While other factions focused on rebuilding the economy, Valois advocated accelerating militarization and reclaiming lost French territories. Early on, his nationalist rhetoric attracted little attention, but as the Commune's economy recovered, the public began reevaluating revanchism toward Germany.\n\nValois claimed that before his death, Sorel's ideas turned toward centralization and that the general strike myth no longer supported building the new society—especially while French lands remained occupied. Seeking a sustaining myth for the post-revolution era, Valois embraced French nationalism, revanchism, and integrated 'warrior culture' into this new mythos—coining it the 'Worker's National Myth.'\n\nEconomically, the Old Guards promoted an 'organic national economy' united in purpose—currently aimed at a decisive struggle against German imperialism. While this implies political centralization, they opposed dictatorship per se. Rather, they sought national-level centralization, advocating empowering the BGT with more authority, abolishing the CSP, and merging legislative and executive powers into a supreme parliamentary body."

After the Vanguard's emergence, Valois did not oppose them, instead courting them as a 'Sorelian alliance.' However, disliking party politics, the Youths formed the 'Sorel Club,' a political society cooperating with the National Syndicalist Alliance but remaining outside the BGT.\n\nThe Sorel Club includes not only non-Valois Sorelians but also André Breton-led surrealists and various avant-garde factions.

The air in a workers' tavern was thick and heavy like congealed butter, mixed with the scents of sweat, tobacco, and cheap wine.\n\nÉtienne Rousseau felt like an outsider. And indeed he was. Three months ago, he bade farewell to the forgotten, barren lands of central France and his small family farm, carrying the Commune's recruitment promise and a thick country accent to this beast of steel and steam. By day, in the Renault factory workshop, he used hands accustomed to dirt and plows to tend to cold stamping machines. By night, he came here, trying to wash away the fatigue and loneliness of the day with a drink.\n\nTrouble found him here.\n\nAt the next table sat several young men in neat work clothes. They were the darlings of the Paris Commune — technical school students, future engineers. Their conversation was filled with terms Étienne couldn't understand and a natural, condescending confidence.\n\n"... So the root problem lies in the alienation of production relations, not the productive forces themselves..." said one bespectacled youth, speaking grandly, his gaze sweeping over Étienne with a faint, barely perceptible sneer. "Of course, it might be a bit difficult to get some comrades to understand this."\n\nHis companions chuckled softly. Another tall, thin youth spoke quietly, but his voice was like a sharp needle: "Look at his hands. Pure labor power. They send their strongest beasts to Paris to turn the gears, while they stay in the countryside enjoying the modern life we create. This is the revolutionary division of urban and rural labor, isn't it?"\n\nThe tavern's noise seemed to drop by several decibels instantly. Étienne clenched his glass, his knuckles whitening from force. He raised his head, met those mocking eyes, and said each word clearly: "My hands are meant to grow the bread you talk about. These hands, like yours that fiddle with blueprints, serve France. No, these hands are more important—without bread, your theories and gears are just piles of rusty scrap."\n\nThe air stiffened. The bespectacled youth stood, his face flushed red. "Rusty scrap? You call the industrial heart of the revolution rusty scrap? What do you know, country bumpkin! We are building a brand new nation with science and order, while you peasants only know to face the dirt, backs bent like centuries ago! You are France's past; we are the future!"\n\n"The future doesn't fill the belly!" Étienne stood, overturning his glass.\n\nA scuffle broke out but was quickly pulled apart by other workers. Yet it no longer mattered. This argument over bread and gears was like a drop of ink in France's seemingly clear water. The next day, Paris tabloids reported with incendiary headlines — "A Peasant's Ignorance and Resentment Towards Industry." Meanwhile, provincial papers countered with — "The Arrogance of the City: Who Is Ungrateful?"\n\nA small incident, at a wrong moment, became a lever capable of prying the entire nation.

  cofpolitics.101.desc:0 "Pierre Dubois flicked the ember of his poor-quality cigarette with rough fingers. A veteran fitter who had worked his whole life at the Renault factory, his hands were covered with scars left before and after the revolution. In 1919, he had built barricades in Saint-Antoine's suburbs with comrades; a bullet fragment from an Order Party policeman still remained in his leg.\n\nHe had always regarded the CGT as his home. The union gave him dignity, bread, and this worker's France. But now, with 1936's election posters plastered on factory walls, calling everyone to unite again under the Syndicalist banner, he felt unprecedented confusion.\n\nThe "CGT case" was a thorn deeply piercing many old workers' hearts. They saw union officials riding in cars, pontificating in the General Council, while their pensions were repeatedly delayed due to "financial coordination difficulties." They saw non-CGT comrades, who had also shed blood for the revolution, excluded from the system and living in hardship.\n\nLast night, his youngest son, a young sailor in the port of Marseille, sent him a letter full of Sorelian stirring slogans. In the factory, some young technicians privately circulated Jacobin pamphlets, dreaming of the bright prospects of "efficiency" and "order." Even his best old buddy began whispering that Comrade Gascon of the Worker-Peasant Opposition was the one truly caring for all laborers.\n\nDubois looked at the faded old poster on the wall that read "Unity is Strength" and sighed deeply. The gears of revolution still seemed to turn, but somewhere, they had rusted."

  cofpolitics.102.title:0 "The Voice of the Land"
  cofpolitics.102.desc:0 "In a small village in the Loire Valley, Mathieu Lejeune was repairing the roof of his barn. The setting sun stretched his shadow long and reflected off the distant church steeple. His grandfather had been a tenant farmer for the king, his father a self-owning farmer of the Republic, and he, now, a member of an agricultural cooperative under the French Commune. Titles changed, but the toil of the land never did.\n\nThe Paris election felt as distant to Mathieu as a weather forecast. What concerned him was this year's harvest, the cooperative's grain purchase price, and whether his daughter could attend church service next Sunday. The Syndicalist government, to him, cared only for urban workers' interests. They took most of the grain but left them only receipts printed with pretty slogans and some questionable-quality industrial goods.\n\nHowever, this election seemed different. Last week, a man claiming to be from the Worker-Peasant Opposition came to see him. He spoke kindly, lacking the arrogance of Parisians. He didn't talk big about "revolutionary theory," but asked about Mathieu's difficulties and told him their leader, Comrade Gascon, was also a farmer's son who respected their beliefs and promised to raise grain purchase prices.\n\nMore surprisingly, even the usually haughty Jacobins sent someone with pamphlets. The brochures showed brand new tractors and fertilizer factories, promising a state-led, modern agricultural future. This intrigued some of the village's youth fascinated by new technologies.\n\nThe village priest, after Sunday sermon, warned the villagers warily about the Sorelians who preached "atheism" and "struggle," but some elders who had lost sons in the war found the Sorelians' "Defend France" slogans powerful.\n\nMathieu sat on the doorstep, looking over his land. He had always believed that hard work would pay off. But now he realized that, like the weather, who they chose to represent them could decide the harvest of this land."

  cofpolitics.103.desc:0 "Antoine carefully wiped the glass window of his small bookstore, sunlight casting a warm glow over the old book covers on display. This shop was everything to him. He had once been a typesetter at a printing house; the revolution freed him from his boss's exploitation and gave him the chance to buy this little shop with years of savings and skill. He was no great man, just an ordinary person who loved books and believed in creating value with his own hands.\n\nBut now, the election posters plastered on the wall across the street troubled him. Every faction claimed to represent the "people," but he was unsure if he still belonged to that "people."\n\nThe Syndicalists still considered him a "worker brother," but their rules favored big factories, and small shop owners like him always ended up last when applying for new printing licenses. The Worker-Peasant Opposition called to help the lowest laborers, which frightened him — now that he had some "property," would he be counted among those to be "leveled"? The Sorelians' violent aesthetic slogans disgusted him; he just wanted to quietly run his little world.\n\nThe only faction he felt a slight resonance with was the Jacobins. They preached "order" and emphasized "expertise," making Antoine think a government that respected knowledge and craftsmanship might make his business easier. Yet their brochures also showed huge factories and uniform communities, and he worried if his small, characterful bookstore would have any place in the Jacobins' grand blueprint.\n\nHe looked at his ink-stained but no longer calloused hands. He was no longer a pure proletarian, but definitely not an exploiter of the old era either. He was just Antoine, a man who had built a small kingdom through his own effort. But in this election deciding France's fate, he found no throne prepared for him."

  cofpolitics.104.desc:0 "In the courtyard of the Sorbonne, the afternoon sun was just right. Simone Delacour closed her book, but the words on the pages failed to calm her. As a philosophy student born after the revolution, she had only a vague notion of the "old world" her parents spoke of. To her, the Commune was France, and France was the Commune. But she increasingly felt this Commune was growing old and rigid.\n\nThe election uproar swept through campus too, turning the ivory tower into a frontline of ideas.\n\nAt yesterday's debate, a young Jacobin professor gave a stirring speech. He painted a future ruled by science and reason, planned by the smartest minds, a perfect state without waste or infighting. His logical and powerful words moved Simone and many classmates, who longed for a more orderly, stronger France.\n\nBut by night, at the student council meeting, the atmosphere was different. Anarchists fiercely attacked all forms of authority, whether CGT bureaucrats or the Jacobins' attempt to build an "expert dictatorship." They called for true direct democracy, for power to return to every neighborhood and community. This pure ideal of defying all authority naturally attracted rebellious youth.\n\nWhat fascinated Simone most was the "Sorel Club," a mysterious, semi-secret salon. There, people discussed not politics or economics, but Nietzsche, Freud, and mythology. Bataille's followers used obscure poetry and bold art to proclaim a "spiritual inward revolution," aiming to overturn all existing values. This dangerous yet alluring thought stirred great waves in young intellectuals like Simone seeking ultimate answers.\n\nShe gazed at Sorel's statue in the courtyard, lost in thought. The revolution of her parents' generation had ended, but the revolution belonging to their generation seemed only just beginning."

  cofpolitics.105.title:0 "The Engine of the State"
  cofpolitics.105.desc:0 "Lucien Fevre had worked at the Ministry of Economic Affairs for fifteen years. His office was piled with documents and charts, each representing the economic pulse of some part of the Commune gone awry. He was not a revolutionary but a civil servant. His ideal was not to build a utopia, but to keep the complex machine of the state running smoothly.\n\nBut in these sixteen years, he felt he spent most of his time fighting chaos. Decrees from the General Council and directives from the Comité de Salut Public often contradicted each other; economic data submitted by local Communes was a mess; CGT representatives acted like independent monarchs, disdainful of departmental coordination. He longed for order, a clear, top-down chain of command, and for his carefully crafted economic plans to actually be executed instead of becoming scrap paper in endless political squabbles.\n\nThis election was an opportunity for a civil servant like him.\n\nThe Jacobins' program caught his eye. They promised to establish a strong Central Planning Committee, grant real power to technocrats, and integrate the entire country into an efficient economy. To Lucien, this was a dream come true.\n\nThe Syndicalists' slogan was "Maintain Stability." Some of his old colleagues supported this, fearing drastic changes would ruin everything and lead to new chaos. But Lucien had had enough of this inefficient "stability."\n\nThe Sorelians' proposal gave him an unsettling attraction. They promised to replace all quarrels with "One Leader, One Goal," using an iron fist to clear all administrative obstacles. This decisive power sounded tempting, but he worried if, once the state was driven entirely by "the will to fight," his rational data and charts on his desk would still matter.\n\nAs for the Worker-Peasant Opposition, especially the anarchists, Lucien could barely imagine it. A state whose power was completely decentralized to 36,000 Communes? That wouldn't be a government, but an administrative disaster.\n\nLucien adjusted his glasses and quietly circled his preferred candidate on a note in front of him."

  cofpolitics.106.desc:0 "Sergeant Jean-Paul Bertrand carefully wiped his rifle with an oiled cloth; the pungent smell of gun oil mixed with tobacco and damp wool filled the barracks at Verdun Fortress. As a professional soldier who had served ten years in the Federal Army, he believed in order, discipline, and firepower. Yet the upcoming election brought unprecedented challenges to these beliefs during the nighttime debates in the barracks.\n\nSeveral young corporals recently promoted from the Commune Guard fiercely discussed an anarchist newspaper. They loudly spoke of "Soldiers' Councils" and "elected officers," believing the military hierarchy itself was an oppression that must be crushed. Bertrand frowned; to him, this was suicide.\n\nElsewhere, a young lieutenant from the Saint-Cyr Military Academy showed fellow officers a Jacobin pamphlet. It depicted impregnable modern fortresses and clear command hierarchies. "Look at the Germans," he said quietly but firmly, "their army is a precise machine, a brain commanding all limbs. We need such an army too—a professional armed force led by true experts, highly centralized command, capable of decisive defense." Bertrand thought there was some truth in this.\n\nHowever, the loudest voices in the barracks were always those of the veterans wearing World War medals. Gathered around the stove, they loudly recited Valois's "Warrior's Manifesto." They spoke not of tactics but of "honor," "sacrifice," and "the soul of France." They believed the army should not just defend borders but be a forge for reshaping the nation's spirit—a brotherhood full of "warrior culture." This passionate zeal felt both familiar and strange to Bertrand.\n\nThe Syndicalist representatives were a few taciturn old non-commissioned officers. They did not join any debate but quietly maintained their weapons in a corner or taught new recruits tactical drills. When Bertrand asked one of them for his view, the old sergeant calmly replied, "Sergeant, an army is an army. Its duty is to defend the Commune, not to pick sides in Paris's political games. Our bayonets should be united outward, not inward. No matter who quarrels in the General Council, our work does not change."\n\nBertrand stopped his work and looked at his rifle. Cold and reliable, it obeyed orders alone. He began to wonder: this rifle, and the hand that held it, ultimately should answer to whose command?"

  cofpolitics.107.desc:0 "In a smoke-filled tavern in Rennes, the mournful tune of a Celtic harp was intermittently broken by heated debate. The poet Ronan Legoff took a sip of local cider, listening to his comrades' words clash in the air. They were the heart of the "Breton Renaissance Movement" — teachers, fishermen, dockworkers, and dreamers. The Paris election felt like a political game from a faraway land, but they knew its outcome would decide the future of this granite soil.\n\n"Comrade Gascon is one of us!" a fisherman from Paimpol shouted, his voice rough as the waves. "His veins run with Breton blood! Only he will fight in Paris for our fishing subsidies and our language. Trusting a Breton is better than trusting a Parisian!" His words earned many pragmatic nods.\n\n"Pragmatism? Trading our culture for Parisian charity?" a young schoolteacher retorted, eyes shining with idealism. "Look at the Jacobins' plan! Yes, they promise modern ports and factories, but they also demand a 'unified national education'! That means our children will be forbidden to speak Breton at school; our history will be replaced by the grand narrative of France. We cannot sell our souls for material wealth!"\n\n"Souls?" a taciturn sculptor suddenly spoke, his fingers thick and strong from years of working stone. "Souls aren't preserved by begging Paris's pity. Have you heard? The Sorelians talk about 'souls' and 'myths' too. They want to awaken a primal, powerful spirit. Isn't that exactly our Celtic spirit? Rooted in forests, seas, and ancient legends! We don't need Paris's approval; what we need is our own spiritual rebirth!"\n\nA dockworkers' union representative, who had once been arrested for organizing strikes, slammed his cup on the table. "Language and myth are fine, but they don't fill bellies or resist the Germans. You're too naive! Comrade Doriot is right: weak debates are useless. Only discipline, organization, and action can seize what we want. We can use their power to achieve our goals!"\n\nRonan listened to the debates, filled with mixed emotions. Trusting a fellow countryman pragmatically, choosing modernization at the cost of losing oneself, embracing a dangerous yet alluring spiritual revolution, or gambling on a calculating political game? He glanced outside; the ancient cobblestones stretched under moonlight, silently telling the thousand-year-old struggles and choices of this land."

Among them were dockworkers from Algeria like him, Tunisian students fleeing the reactionary rule of National France, and Senegalese veterans who had been heavily discriminated against in the old Republican army. The French Commune was a beacon across the Mediterranean, a promised land where "proletarians of the world were brothers."\n\nBut now, the election storm had blown into this small café, testing their beliefs.\n\nThe Sorelians' calls for "warriors," "honor," and "the soul of France" made the Senegalese veterans uneasy. They recalled how white officers in the old army, shouting "For France," had treated them with whips and contempt. "When they talk about a 'pure French spirit,' beware," one hoarsely warned.\n\nThe Jacobins' idea of a "unified nation" also made them wary. "A strong, unified France?" the young Tunisian student sneered. "We fled from that kind of 'unity' oppression! In their blueprint, what will become of us 'outsiders'? Will we be assimilated like in Algiers, treated as second-class citizens?"\n\n"So our only way out is true internationalism!" shouted a radical Moroccan comrade who had organized general strikes in Spain, raising his fist. "A workers' union without borders or nations! Only the anarchist ideal can guarantee we won't be judged by our origins!"\n\n"Naïve!" a Russian technician who had worked in German factories retorted. "When society falls into chaos, we are the first to be sacrificed. I'd rather choose the Jacobins' order! A strong, rational state at least guarantees equality before the law instead of letting us be devoured by populism in the name of 'freedom.'"\n\nAmar listened silently. He was just an ordinary man wanting to earn his bread with his own strength. What mattered most was protecting the organization that supported these outsiders—the CGT. It was the Syndicalist union that gave him work and shelter when he clashed with local workers. He didn't understand the deep theories, but he knew the CGT system, though corrupt, was the only real power they could rely on in this country."

People flooded the streets, waving red flags and singing the Internationale, celebrating the staggering of the German giant that loomed over Europe. In the street-corner cafés, election debates were pushed to a fever pitch by the sudden news.\n\n"See it? This is capitalism's ultimate fate!" a bespectacled student excitedly pounded the table, drawing attention. "This proves Marx's prophecy! We shouldn't waste time arguing inside France but immediately spread our revolutionary model—a free, decentralized syndicalist union—to the world! German workers are waiting for us!" He was clearly an anarchist believer.\n\n"Spread our current chaos?" a neatly dressed man, who looked like an engineer, sneered in reply. "Young man, don't be naive. Germany's collapse reveals flaws in their system. This is a rare opportunity. We should emulate their strengths—discipline, efficiency, strong central planning—to build a superior nation instead of repeating their failures. We need a well-planned France that solves the German problem once and for all!" His words represented the Jacobin view.\n\nAn old veteran with worn medals slammed his glass heavily on the table. "Still discussing economics? Money, stocks, markets… these mean nothing in a real crisis! What Germany needs now isn't a new economic model but will! Spirit! The courage to fight! This proves only our path is right!" The Sorelians' call drew cheers.\n\nThe café owner, a Syndicalist who had spent half his life in the union, quietly wiped glasses as he listened. Having lived through revolutions and enjoyed their peace, he quietly told a regular nearby, "The Germans have fallen, but we shouldn't rush to kick them while they're down. Who knows if they'll rise again soon? What we need most now is stability, consolidating our own economy, not letting outside storms cloud our minds. Let them rot on their own; that benefits us most."\n\nThe debate yielded no conclusion, but all knew the collapse of Berlin had made Paris's crossroads clearer. A major decision was imminent."

CGT chairman Monnet stood on the platform, facing a sea of red flags, delivering his usual call for workers to unite under CGT leadership and carry the revolution through. The crowd below, mostly children of revolutionaries proud of their parents' legacy, cheered enthusiastically.\n\nHowever, when Monnet spoke of 'sacrificing the small self for the greater self,' a dissenting voice with a provincial accent shouted, "Are our farmer brothers also 'small selves'?" The question rippled like a stone thrown into a lake.\n\n"We don't need hollow unity; we need tractors and higher productivity!" another voice agreed, clearly a Jacobin supporter. Then a more aggressive voice cried out, "Our comrades are still oppressed by the Germans, and you talk about unity here!"\n\nMonnet tried to calm the turmoil, raising his voice: "Whether peasants or workers, all are brothers in our revolution! And improving productivity requires the unity of all comrades…" But it was too late. The crowd became chaotic; supporters of opposing views pushed and shouted. Soon, the political rally descended into ugly street fighting.\n\nPolice tried to restore order but soon realized many fighters wore "People's Defense" armbands.

The traditional "Commune Debate" became the prime stage for all factions. Held in a large hall at the University of Paris and broadcast nationwide, it had evolved into an unwritten but crucial election-time ritual.\n\nThe hall was packed, the air thick with anticipation and tension. The Syndicalist representative was an experienced veteran union leader aiming to reaffirm the importance of unity and stability. The Worker-Peasant Opposition spokesman was a sharp-tongued anarchist ready to fiercely attack CGT privileges. The Jacobins sent a clear-thinking young professor with documents and charts. The Sorelians' representative was a sharp-eyed veteran who lost an arm in the war.\n\nIn brief opening statements, each faction outlined core positions: Syndicalists called for "unity to protect hard-won revolutionary gains"; opponents demanded "returning power to every laborer"; Jacobins advocated "order and efficiency to build a strong republic"; Sorelians claimed "only fighting spirit can reshape France's soul."\n\nWith opening remarks finished, the moderator stepped forward and addressed the crowd and the millions listening on the radio: "Comrades, we have heard the voices of all factions.

"We have broken the capitalist chains, yet we remain bound by patriarchal ones! Marriage, family, childbirth… these old tools of oppression still erode women comrades' freedom. True liberation is freeing women from all imposed identities, becoming whole, independent individuals!" Her speech sparked enthusiastic applause among students and young women.\n\nThe Sorelians' veteran scoffed. "Freedom? Weak freedom only leads to decadence! French women don't need bourgeois salon talk; they need honor and duty! Their mission is to be strong mothers, raising healthy, fighting-spirited warriors for the Commune. This is their highest calling and greatest contribution to the revolution!"\n\nThe Jacobin professor adjusted his glasses and spoke in an unemotional tone: "Comrades, emotions and missions are important, but we should focus on data. Statistics show that freeing female labor from tedious housework and integrating it into industry can increase our GDP by at least 15%. Therefore, the state should invest heavily in public canteens, daycare, and laundries. This is not for abstract 'liberation' but for France's strength."\n\nThe Syndicalist representative cleared his throat, trying to reconcile contradictions: "Comrades, we always believe the core of women's rights is economic rights. We strive to promote equal pay and representation of women comrades in unions. That is our most pragmatic and core task at present. As for more complex issues..."\n\nThe moderator interrupted: "Then specifically, how does the Syndicalist faction propose to continue advancing women's liberation?""

What a tired cliché!" she retorted mercilessly, "You talk about equal pay, yet turn a blind eye to the deeply entrenched male leadership within the CGT! You speak of protections but have never considered reforming the patriarchal structure that binds women to the home! If this is the Syndicalists' idea of 'progress,' then what's the difference from the handouts of the old world?" Her challenge sparked a stir among the student audience.\n\nThe Jacobin professor cleared his throat calmly and added, "The passion of this comrade is commendable, but we must respect objective laws. Data shows that in heavy industry and high-intensity technical roles, men's physiological advantages yield higher productivity. We certainly support women's participation in labor, but it must be based on a scientific social division of labor, not to satisfy some abstract slogan of equality."\n\nThe Sorelist veteran shook his head; his voice rasped like sandpaper through the air. "You are all measuring the revolution with bourgeois rulers! Equality? Efficiency? These cold words erase the fundamental forces of life. Men and women are not the same cogs; we are the union of fire and earth! A man's duty is on the battlefield and the forge, fighting external enemies with steel and blood; while a woman's strength lies in shaping our nation's soul, in nurturing and passing on the unyielding revolutionary spirit. Turning them into bureaucrats or workers like men is not liberation—it's a devaluation and denial of their deeper, more mysterious power. France does not need more clerks; she needs mothers who birth heroes, guardians of the revolutionary spirit!"\n\nThe atmosphere in the hall grew increasingly tense as opposing views clashed fiercely, all eyes once again fixed on the Syndicalist representative, awaiting his final stance."

We do not oppose women comrades serving the Commune, but any appointment must be based on strict ability and qualification review. Placing inexperienced comrades in key positions for the sake of so-called 'political correctness' is a severe blow to the Commune's administrative efficiency. We cannot gamble with the nation's future." His words drew quiet approval from bureaucrats and technicians in the audience.\n\nThe Sorelist veteran showed no concealment of his contempt: "Management? Letting women manage men? That's the most ridiculous joke I've heard! It's a subversion of order, a betrayal of nature! A man who needs a woman to tell him what to do is neither a true man nor a qualified revolutionary!"\n\nThis combined attack, mixing elitism and conservatism, left the Syndicalist representative in an awkward position.

This is the greatest insult to French men! If we need women to defend our homes, what right do we have to call ourselves 'warriors'? Our duty is to face enemy bullets with our chests, not to hide behind women's skirts! You are emasculating the very spirit of France!"\n\nThe Jacobin professor showed a look of incomprehension, adjusted his tie, and said in a nearly pitying tone: "Comrade, please remain rational. I understand your revolutionary passion, but this does not comply with any principles of military science. Allowing untrained and physically weaker civilians, regardless of gender, to enter the army en masse will only cause logistical chaos, command failure, and needless casualties. This is an emotionally driven, extremely dangerous proposal. We should trust our professional soldiers, not this kind of political propaganda."\n\nCaught between the veteran and professor's attacks, the Syndicalist representative's position became extremely difficult."

Our responsibility is victory! Weak aid and cheap sympathy are useless. We must show these 'eager to be liberated' peoples what true power is, what fighting will means! Let them see our example and learn to take up arms themselves! We are to ignite the torch of fire, not hand out bread like nannies!"\n\n"To liberate with empty spirit?" the Jacobin professor retorted coldly, "Comrade, liberation is not a street fight. It is a complex project requiring precise calculation and long-term planning. Our duty is to prioritize regions of greatest strategic value to France, making targeted, controllable investments. Supporting a pro-French, stable regime is far wiser than inciting uncontrolled, chaotic uprisings. We are chess players, not gamblers."\n\n"Listen to that speech!" the Anarchist representative stood excitedly, "Chess players? That elitist tone again! The liberation of the oppressed is not some strategic game planned by a committee in Paris! Our responsibility is unconditional and internationalist! Wherever comrades bleed, we must feel it too! We must break all borders, sharing our weapons, resources, everything with them! Revolution is not a transaction, it is our innate moral duty!"\n\nThe hall was once again drowned in voices.

It resonated with some, but sparked anger in others.\n\nThe day after the debate ended, protest crowds returned to the streets of Paris. Leading the front were young students and revolutionary exiles from around the world. They raised banners reading "Weakness is Betrayal!" and "Is Internationalism Dead?" gathering before the General Council, singing "The Internationale," condemning the Syndicalists' conservative stance as a betrayal of the world proletariat.\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the city, harder groups began to take action. The Sorelist veteran and Jacobin interventionists gathered in taverns and clubs, mocking the Syndicalists' "cowardice." They argued this inward, self-protective posture was tantamount to showing weakness before German imperialists and reactionaries in Algiers. They distributed leaflets questioning: "What's the difference between a beacon that won't shine and a rock?"\n\nThe Syndicalist leadership found itself trapped in a dilemma.

His voice echoed through the hall and throughout all of France: "Comrades, now, let us talk about the empire across the Rhine. Germany—our neighbor, our enemy, the greatest shadow on our revolutionary path. What are your thoughts on our future with it?"\n\nThe Sorelist veteran suddenly stood up, his eyes burning with the fire of vengeance: "Future? Our future is the red flag flying over their parliament! There is no peace between us and Germany, only war! The shame of the Marne must be washed with blood; Alsace-Lorraine must be returned! We don't need waiting or planning, we need the will to fight!"\n\nThe Jacobin professor disdainfully pushed up his glasses: "Comrades, hearing these warmongering cries shocks me. Haven't we learned enough from the last world war? War is a slaughterhouse for civilization, a graveyard for revolutionary ideals. Our goal is not to launch another devastating war, but to build a France so powerful that Germany dares not covet it—through a highly organized, expert-led planned economy. When our industrial output is twice theirs, and our technology far surpasses theirs, peace will come. War is the product of impulse and incompetence; we represent reason and the future."\n\nThe Anarchist representative also stood, her voice clear and firm: "You are all wrong! Our enemy is not 'Germany,' but the German Empire—this machine of oppression, ruled by the Junker aristocracy and capitalists! German workers are our brothers, not our enemies! Our task is not to bomb their cities but to arm their revolution! Through our comrades there, ignite the revolutionary fire from within, and build a German Commune! That is the only path to lasting peace!"\n\nAll eyes once again focused on the Syndicalist representative, who stood for the Commune's official line of the past sixteen years."

  cofpolitics.119.title:0 "The Vote of the Alsatians"
  cofpolitics.119.desc:0 "In a small village in Champagne, surrounded by vineyards, the sun was just right. But today, Émile Vogt felt no warmth at all. He sat under the old oak at the village entrance, tightly clutching a brand-new voting card symbolizing his adulthood and citizenship. His friends—Pierre, Jacques, Étienne—looked at him with mixed envy and expectation. Because they were a few months younger, they all missed this election. Among this group of childhood friends, only Émile could cast the decisive vote for the future.\n\nÉmile was not very politically sensitive. His world should have been the grape harvest and his mother's occasional homesickness. He was born in Alsace; his mother tongue was German, but his mother told him from an early age: "Remember, child, your heart is French." After the revolution, they fled their homeland annexed by Germany and settled here. What he remembered was only peace under the Commune and the unerasable longing for their homeland in his mother's eyes.\n\n"What are you hesitating for, Émile?" Uncle Jean-Pierre, the Syndicalist representative of the village cooperative, approached with a voice as mellow as aged champagne. "It is the Commune and the CGT that gave us land and peace. We are workers, we are peasants, we should trust the system built for us."\n\n"But this system is forgetting us!" Mark, a young Communist who worked in the fields with them, retorted, his face still smeared with dirt. "The bureaucrats in Paris only think about their factories, not our harvest! Only Comrade Jaxon truly cares about us, the people of the land!"\n\nÉtienne's uncle, a technical bureaucrat visiting from Bordeaux dressed in a neat suit, took out a poster depicting grand factories and orderly city planning. "Children, look at this. This is the future." He said with an unquestionable tone, "Emotion and tradition cannot compete with German steel. Only the Jacobin plan and order can build a truly strong France, a country we can hold our heads high in."\n\nAt that moment, a tall, dark figure approached. It was their childhood elder brother, Luc. Fresh from federal army service, he still carried the hardened look of the barracks. He looked at Émile, fire in his eyes. "A strong country?" He sneered, "Cowardly plans will never bring strength. Émile, you're different from us; you understand 'home' better than any of us. Home isn't won by compromise or calculation, but by fighting and sacrifice! Only the Sorelists know how to defend our honor with the enemy's blood and reclaim what is rightfully ours—like Alsace!"\n\nAll eyes focused on Émile. He stared at the voting card in his hand as if it weighed a thousand pounds. He was a German-speaking Frenchman, a farmer from lost lands, a youth under the Commune. Who was he really? Whom should he trust? His vote was not only for himself but for all his friends who could not vote."

  cofpolitics.120.desc:0 "Night in Lyon mixed the dampness of the Saône River with the residual warmth from factory chimneys. But in the small apartment of the Girod family, the dinner atmosphere was somewhat heavy.\n\nAdèle Girod absentmindedly fiddled with the potatoes on her plate. Her father, a Syndicalist who had worked all his life in the local silk factory, had just returned from a heated union meeting, bringing all his political moods home. "...Those Jacobin intellectuals, what do they know about labor? And that bunch of Sorelist madmen, what else can they do besides shouting slogans?" he said, stabbing the sausage hard with his fork. "Adèle, you're an adult now; this is your first election. Have you decided who to vote for?"\n\n"I don't know," Adèle said softly, "Dad, they all sound the same to me..." She summoned courage and spoke her mind: "And Paris is so far away, does it really matter if I vote or not?"\n\nHer father's fork clattered onto the plate. He stared hard at his daughter, his eyes full of disappointment and incredulous anger. "Doesn't matter?" His voice trembled, "Every inch of land beneath your feet, every bite of bread you eat, every breath of free air you take was bought with the blood of comrades you've never seen! When we were in the barricades, no one asked 'does it matter?' We only knew that if we don't fight, you—and thousands like you—will be squeezed dry in the capitalist factories! Voting isn't a game, Adèle, it's a responsibility! A responsibility to those who sacrificed!"\n\nHe pushed back his chair abruptly, walked into his room, and slammed the door.\n\nDinner ended in awkward silence. Late at night, her mother quietly came to Adèle's room and sat beside her bed. "Don't blame your father," she whispered, stroking her daughter's hair, "he's just... afraid. Afraid we forget how all this came to be. Afraid we take the fruits of the revolution for apples falling from trees."\n\nHer mother paused, then continued: "I don't understand all those big ideas either. But I know that those elected tomorrow will decide if our factory runs or stops next year, if your brother, once enlisted, guards the border or is sent overseas, if ordinary people like us live better or worse. Your vote might not change France, but it will change our family. So, child, cast the vote you believe in, for yourself."\n\nAfter her mother left, Adèle sat alone by the window, looking at Lyon's scattered lights. She thought of her father's angry face and her mother's gentle words. For the first time, she felt the thin ballot carried such heavy weight. It connected past and future, the fate of a family, and the course of a nation.\n\nShe took out the blank ballot and gazed at it long under the kerosene lamp."

  cofpolitics.121.desc:0 "The election results arrived, and for a moment, the air in Paris seemed to freeze—then it resumed its familiar rhythm. The Syndicalists—the cornerstone of the revolution, the helmsmen of the Commune—once again secured dominance over the Bourse Générale du Travail. There was no grand celebration, no angry protests, only a complex calm enveloping the city.\n\nFor many, this was an expected outcome. For old workers like Pierre Dubois, it meant the world he knew would continue; pensions might still be delayed, but the union's banner would keep flying. For civil servants like Lucien Fevre, it meant continuing to work amid familiar chaos, complaining about inefficiency while relieved that things hadn't gotten worse.\n\nIn a small village in Champagne, Émile Vogt's friends patted him on the shoulder, telling him "at least it hasn't gotten worse." And in Lyon's apartment, Adèle Girod perhaps felt that the vote she cast for stability had indeed smoothed some of the wrinkles on her father's face.\n\nThe Syndicalists' victory was not a passionate triumph, but like a weathered ocean liner steering wearily back to its familiar course after avoiding all dangerous reefs. The storm had passed—for now—but everyone knew those reefs still lurked beneath the surface, waiting for the next wind to rise."

In the Loire Valley, Mathieu Lejand and his neighbors felt for the first time that the "big shots" in Paris had finally heard the voice of the land. In Lyon, Adèle Girod may have noticed an unfamiliar mixture of hope and unease in her father's eyes.\n\nIt was an undeniable political earthquake. The communists and anarchists, long branded as separatists and opposition, had become the nation's nominal top leaders. Jaxon and his comrades promised the people a future more equal, freer, and with power truly returned to the grassroots. But they faced a harsh reality: how to implement their radical reforms in a country already accustomed to CGT leadership?\n\nCheers rang through the skies, but beneath this victorious euphoria, a massive question mark hung over the French Commune."

France had ushered in an age of reason.\n\nIn the Ministry of Economic Affairs office, Lucien Fevre for the first time saw the mountains of paperwork before him not as scrap but as achievable blueprints. At the Saint-Cyr military academy, young officers seemed to glimpse the embryo of a modern army with flawless command and cutting efficiency. In Champagne, Émile Vogt's friend Étienne excitedly described the letter from his uncle about a "planned, scientific, and immensely powerful France."\n\nA whole new era was about to dawn. Chaos would be replaced by order; local interests integrated into national planning. Endless disputes and inefficiencies would fall silent before a strong central government. France would become a precise machine, running at full throttle toward an immensely powerful future.\n\nYet beneath this glow of reason, shadows quietly grew. In Lyon's apartment, Adèle's father anxiously switched off the radio. At the Sorbonne, Simone Delacour and her friends felt a biting chill. They knew that when "reason" becomes the sole truth, all "irrational" emotions, freedoms, and humanity might be deemed "errors" to be purged."

This was no ordinary transfer of power; it was a mythical triumph.\n\nThe port of Marseille erupted in thunderous cheers, the name Valois echoed through the skies. In a small tavern in Rennes, the silent sculptor raised his glass high, eyes glittering with fervor. In the Verdun barracks, veterans embraced, tears streaming down their faces. Even Luke from Champagne proclaimed loudly to Émile and his friends, "See? The fighting spirit of France is not dead!"\n\nA brand new, unpredictable era had arrived. Reason, metrics, compromise… these stale words would be thrown into the dustbin of history. In their place came will, passion, sacrifice, and honor. The nation was no longer a cold machine but a living organism, a mythical community born for battle and victory.\n\nYet behind this fervent flame lay countless worries. In a café in Lyon, Amal and his immigrant friends felt palpable fear. In the ivory towers of the Sorbonne, Simone Delacour knew a crueler war than any factional struggle—one for minds and souls—was about to begin.\n\nFrance had chosen the most dangerous, seductive, and deadly path.

Like every morning for the past thirty years, he brewed a strong pot of coffee and ate a piece of day-old bread, beginning his day's work.\n\nHe walked to the window of his office, where dawn was casting a soft golden edge over Paris. The city was waking—the factory chimneys released the first wisps of smoke, and on distant rail lines, coal trains breathed heavily. All of it felt as familiar as the callouses on his hands.\n\nHe had won. Or rather, they had not lost. The Syndicalists—this rusted but still immense ship—had once again steered back onto its established course. But Jouaux felt no joy, only boundless exhaustion. The mountain of reports on his desk was no longer just internal CGT documents but petitions from 36,000 communes across the country, draft bills submitted by various factions, and reports on every worn gear of the Commune's huge machine.\n\nHe picked up the phone and dialed the Public Safety Committee's economic affairs office. "It's me, Jouaux." His voice was as steady as ever. "Send me the latest steel production report again. Yes, right now. We have a lot of work to do."\n\nNo grand speeches, no magnificent blueprints.

A scruffy anarchist was shouting at him, "We support you because we're fed up with the CGT bureaucracy! You must promise us that there will be no new 'red bureaucracy' system!" Before he finished, a rural communist representative immediately retorted, "Without discipline and organization, how do we fight the enemy? Do you want endless debates instead?"\n\nJust as a new argument was about to erupt, Jaxon smiled and raised his hand. His smile had a calming power. "Comrades," he said quietly but louder than all the noise, "I, Marcel Jaxon, a son of a farmer, a communist, am now your elected chairman. I promise you, the new France will have neither a bureaucracy detached from the people nor weak chaos."\n\nHe looked at the anarchist: "Your freedom will be guaranteed." Then to the communist: "Your organization will be respected."\n\nHe lifted a cup of cheap red wine on the table and raised it high: "We may never agree on everything, but we have a common enemy and once shared a dream. Today, we have taken back that dream stolen by the CGT. To the people! To all of us!"\n\nThe crowd erupted in thunderous cheers. Jaxon drained the glass, eyes shining.

Celebration was for the mediocre; for the architect, this was just the first night surveying the construction site. He had won—yet the word tasted hollow on his tongue. Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail, Head of State of the French Commune—an empty title, a larger cage.\n\nHis fingers traced the huge planning map spread on the desk—railways, power grids, industrial zones, clear lines, cold logic. This was his perfect blueprint for France: a rational, efficient, powerful socialist republic. Then he looked up at the complex map of parliamentary seats on the wall. Six hundred and fifty red, yellow, and black dots, like mold growing unchecked in a petri dish, contaminating his clean map. That was reality: a huge, dysfunctional labor council made of local self-interests, factional noise, and endless bickering.\n\nAnd the Public Safety Committee, which should have been the administrative sword in his hand, had been dulled under proportional representation. Its existence was necessary to execute the state will, but in its current form, it was just an extension of the Council's chaos, a committee of conflicting agendas and uneven steps, not the unique, efficient central brain he envisioned.\n\nFootsteps. Adrien Marcay entered, placing a steaming black coffee on a corner of the map. "They gave you the chairman's title, Marcel," Marcay said quietly, like a scalpel, "but kept the keys to the machine for themselves."\n\nDia didn't look at him, eyes fixed on the tainted blueprint.

Though plainly dressed, many bore war wounds, their chests held proudly, eyes sharp as blades.\n\nNo fiery slogans, no blazing flames. Valois wore a neat black coat and slowly walked at the head of the line. He stopped to shake hands with old comrades from the trenches, calling their names and asking after their families. The sunlight reflected solemnly off their old medals and the new Commune badges on their chests.\n\nAfter the review, Valois stepped onto a makeshift podium. He didn't shout, but spoke in a steady, powerful voice:\n\n"Comrades, warriors. Look at yourselves, look at those beside you. You are the backbone of France. It was you who defended the revolution in its darkest hours with blood and sacrifice. Yet over the years, your honor has been forgotten, your sacrifices treated as bargaining chips by chattering politicians."\n\n"They tell us the revolution was for comfort and ease. They are wrong! The revolution is to reshape our nation's soul! To reclaim the honor, responsibility, and brotherhood we once had on the battlefield! I, Georges Valois, am now your Council Chairman. I promise you, from now on, France will once again honor its warriors!"\n\nHe paused, eyes scanning everyone present: "Our first goal is to end this country's shameful division. That so-called 'Public Safety Committee,' the breeding ground of countless bureaucrats and conspiracies, must be abolished! All power will return to the Council representing the fighting will of the people!
