  FRA_totalist_party_long:0 "Confédération Nationale-Syndicaliste/Parti Socialiste de France\n\n§LConfédération Nationale-Syndicaliste\nA party founded by Georges Sorel himself, but taken over by Georges Valois after Sorel's death. Its members are mostly Great War veterans, but it also includes intellectuals who supported Sorel. After the revolution, it briefly formed a parliamentary alliance with the POU and CGT. However, following the death of Georges Sorel, it broke away from the increasingly bureaucratized POU-CGT bloc to focus on managing the reorganized soldier communes in southern France and Marseille. The most important goal of the CNS is revenge against Germany. Although anti-war sentiment dominated the country after the Great War, after years of revolutionary reconstruction, more and more French people have begun to turn toward revanchism. This social shift has allowed the CNS to gain the support of many young radicals. In addition, the CNS maintains a good relationship with the FCF, and some young and radical Catholics choose the CNS as an alternative to the FCF.\n-------------------------\nParti Socialiste de France\nA right-wing group that split from the Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière during the 1925 economic reform debate, choosing to support the POU-CGT bloc's centralization model. They formed the Union Jean Jaurès, led by Marcel Déat, once Léon Blum's most prized protégé. Déat and Adrien Marquet published the 'Neo-Socialist Manifesto' in 1930, reorganizing the UJJ into the PSF. That same year, the Parti populaire français, led by Jacques Doriot, chose to merge into the PSF as a brother party. In subsequent years, due to its unique economic policies, the PSF gained significant ground among the urban middle class, and university economists became more supportive of their proposals.§!\n"

  FRA_syndicalist_party:0 "CGT/POU"
  FRA_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Confédération Générale du Travail/Parti Ouvrier Unifié\n\n§LConfédération Générale du Travail\nThe largest non-party political entity in the BGT and the backbone of the Communal Revolution; it can be said that without the CGT, there would be no Commune of France. After the revolutionary victory, it leveraged its size to absorb numerous independent unions across the country, forming a behemoth that occupies the most seats in the BGT. However, as the period of revolutionary reconstruction ended, more independent unions and political parties began to emerge, and the seats originally belonging to the CGT were gradually divided. Particularly during the 1925 economic reform issue, some CGT seats flowed to independent anarchists and the AFA. Although the CGT still maintains a grand alliance with the POU and AFA, its own influence is constantly being squeezed. The occurrence of the 'Case against the CGT' led to a large number of CGT seats flowing to other factions, forcing the CGT to consider whether it needs to reform itself to ensure its dominant position in parliament.\n-------------------------\nParti Ouvrier Unifié\nFounded during the revolution by Boris Souvarine after he was expelled from the SFIO. During the 1921 Constituent Assembly, it chose to re-align with the CGT, forming a long-term political alliance. As the largest political party in the BGT (excluding the CGT, which is a non-party entity), the POU largely dominated the 1925 economic reforms. This led to polarized evaluations of the POU and eventually caused some anarchists to leave. At the same time, more worker radicals began to support the POU, causing the party to gradually shift toward radical policies. After Benoît Frachon's visit to the United States to observe the Industrial Workers of the World, the party adopted 'Solidarity Unionism' as its ideology. This led the POU to side with the CGT after the 'Case against the CGT' occurred, resulting in a complete break between the AFA and the POU, while some moderate voters began to reconsider their support for the party.§!\n"

  FRA_radical_socialist_party:0 "PCOP/AFA"
  FRA_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Parti Communiste Ouvrier et Paysan/Association des Fédéralistes Anarchistes\n\n§LParti Communiste Ouvrier et Paysan\nThe predecessor of the PCOP was the Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière, which was the third-largest party in parliament during the first federal elections (second only to the CGT and POU). However, with the end of the revolutionary reconstruction period and the departure of the right wing during the 1925 economic reform debate, the SFIO found itself unable to compete with the POU or CGT for worker voters, thus shifting more focus toward peasants and the emerging middle class. Marcel Cachin eventually reorganized the SFIO into the PCOP and worked hard to recall comrades who had been expelled in the past due to political struggles. Ultimately, the PCOP became a 'Left-Wing Big Tent' for Council Communism, Centrist Marxism, and even Bolshevism—just as the SFIO once was. After the 'Case against the CGT', the PCOP successfully challenged the POU-CGT's dominance among urban workers. More importantly, the departure of the AFA gave the PCOP an opportunity; under Cachin's promotion, the PCOP successfully reached an electoral alliance with the AFA, which seems to herald the end of the POU-CGT dynasty.\n-------------------------\nAssociation des Fédéralistes Anarchistes\nOn November 14-15, 1920, Jean Grave and Peter Kropotkin organized the World Anarchist Congress in Paris, where the AFA was formed as a union of multiple regional anarchist groups, appearing as a political organization in the 1921 Charter. As an anarchist group that resolutely opposed the war during the Great War, the AFA expected to win big in the first federal elections. However, the reality was that many anarchists turned to the POU-CGT alliance, making the AFA a small-to-medium party in the first federal elections. Yet, due to the immense influence of anarchism on the revolution, the POU-CGT bloc eventually formed a governing coalition with the AFA. The 1925 economic reform nearly broke the alliance between the AFA and POU-CGT, but under the compromise of the POU-CGT bloc, the AFA maintained its cooperative status. At the same time, some anarchists who had originally run under the POU or CGT banners began to flow back to the AFA. The AFA quickly withdrew from the governing coalition after the 'Case against the CGT', and they were joined by many anarchists who had previously supported the CGT—who now chose to join the AFA. With Marcel Cachin acting as a bridge, the AFA finally formed an electoral alliance with the PCOP to challenge the POU-CGT hegemony.§!\n"

Aristide Briand, leader of the Républicain socialiste, announced 'the end of the war in three months' and signed the 'Matignon Agreement' to quell the strikes. However, after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Philippe Pétain's military coup destroyed the left-wing Republic and granted Joseph Joffre—who had previously fallen from power and retired under Briand—the title of 'Grand Marshal Protector of the State' to act as president. After taking office, Joffre immediately tore up the Treaty of Versailles and issued a mobilization order, arresting and executing former Prime Minister Briand on charges of 'treason,' declaring the Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière and the Confédération Générale du Travail as illegal organizations, and revoking all reform policies in the 'Matignon Agreement.'\n\nGeorges Sorel, who had been calling for peace during the Great War, called for a total revolution and launched a 'General Mutiny' relying on his influence in the military. After being suppressed, the CGT chose to support the Comités Syndicalistes Révolutionnaires formed by Pierre Monatte and decided to join Sorel's revolutionary forces, encouraging union workers to oppose the bourgeois government. Meanwhile, the SFIO in parliament and other center-leftists could not accept the military coup and reactionary rule, openly opposing Joffre's reign. Eventually, civil war broke out, and in the following months, the Republican government was driven out of mainland France by a grand alliance of Sorelian forces, the CGT, and center-left parties.\n\nAfter the revolutionary victory, Georges Sorel served as the temporary chairman of the Commune, but as Sorel's health deteriorated, he could only remain behind the scenes as 'Honorary Chairman,' while the CGT gained leadership of the revolution. Due to the political chaos and economic destruction brought by the Great War and the civil war—especially the destruction of the centralized system during the civil war—the newborn socialist regime eventually chose a compromise 'Parliament-Council' dual-track system. The 1921 Federal Constitution of the Commune of France (the '1921 Constitution') finally stipulated that this country, named the Fédération des Communes de France, is a syndicalist-socialist federal republic. The council system was formalized in the 'Draft for National Economic Reconstruction and Defense of the Revolution.' Although the Comité de Salut Public was seen as a temporary product during the national reconstruction period, in subsequent years, the committee chaired so much reconstruction work that some began to believe it should be retained. Although the Bourse Générale du Travail did deliberate several drafts to abolish the CSP, none were passed by vote.\n\nThe Commune of France has continued to operate based on this 'temporary' political system and has demonstrated the superiority of socialism in the years that followed: the economy has not just been reconstructed, but has developed rapidly. The capitalists who exploited workers disappeared, and many workers began to become wealthy—despite various problems in the Commune's currency and financial system—but for the average person, their lives have become better than in the past. As more of the population became a conscious political force, factions dissatisfied with the rule of the Parti Ouvrier Unifié-CGT bloc began to appear one by one. Although most were unable to defeat the dominant position of the POU-CGT, these factions have also occupied a place in Commune politics through years of political activity.\n\nUntil the outbreak of the 'Case against the CGT' in 1934, the ruling coalition diverged, eventually leading to the break between the POU-CGT bloc and the Association des Fédéralistes Anarchistes, and a political alliance between the Parti Communiste Ouvrier et Paysan and the AFA. The 'Opposition Alliance' of the Parti Socialiste de France and the Confédération Nationale-Syndicaliste also saw an opportunity to replace the CGT. In 1936, Marceau Pivert, then chairman of the CSP, is about to be impeached and step down, which also means that a new election will be launched early. Perhaps in this election, the syndicalist ruling dynasty will meet its end..."

  france_events.1.desc:0 "The question of the federal flag has stood out as a point of long-standing disagreements since the revolutionary days. The red flag, of course, had always been the flag of the proletariat, the flag of the martyrs, the flag of the barricades, and many argued that the Revolution should only fly these colours, a proud declaration of war against the bourgeoisie:0 proletarians have no motherland, after all. However, even though the Tricolour had not been the flag of revolutionary enthusiasm for decades and had degenerated into being merely the flag of the bankers' republic, the flag of the Versaillais of 1871, many felt too attached to it to let it go. Part of the socialist movement, particularly within the SFIO, had long sought to reconquer this flag from the hands of the bourgeois and give it back the same vigour it had when the People faced the monarchs of Europe at Valmy and triumphed. Or they simply worried that abandoning the Red, White and Blue would be too much of a provocation to the world, and to our compatriots who had not fully become comrades just yet.\n\nAnd so a compromise was found, much like in every aspect of the Revolution. The Tricolour was conserved, but was defaced with the symbols of the proletarian struggle, of the workers, of the mutineers, and was always flown alongside the red flag. With our victory in the latest elections, we have been given a popular mandate to finally settle this debate:0 should we keep the compromise of 1920 and the defaced Tricolour, forge a new, redder compromise flag, or simply enshrine the Red once and for all?"

Unquestionably, these individuals cannot shoulder the mantle of the Communal Army; military reform is imperative. However, views on the military vary across society—some groups even view our army as a 'relic of oppression' and advocate for total disbandment, entrusting national security to fragile militia forces.\n\nEven within the military, opinions on reform are divided. The existence of 'Military Unions' has rendered the Communal Army highly politicized, with constant debates between viewing the army as the 'guarantor of national sovereignty' versus the 'vanguard of the syndicalist revolutionary struggle.' The high command is split into three factions: the Conservatives, who wish to maintain the status quo; the Nationalists, who believe the military should be separated from politics; and the Revolutionaries, who see the army as the front line of the revolution. Syndicalists tend to cooperate with military Conservatives, while the Worker-Peasants interact with the Nationalists. However, the Sorelians retain the greatest influence; not only are many high-ranking officers Sorelian supporters, but the rank-and-file soldiers also strongly identify with the 'Warrior Culture' preached by Valois.\n\nJust days before the new elections for the Comité de Salut Public, the respected civil war hero General Gamelin chose not to run as the Syndicalist candidate for Chief of Staff, forcing the Syndicalists to seek a temporary replacement. Meanwhile, the Jacobins, who previously lacked support in the military, have also found collaborators for this election. It seems the race for Chief of Staff will be a closely contested struggle."

Although the revolutionaries learned from the Paris Commune and swiftly seized control of the state banks, true national currency unification was not achieved until 1925. The unbridled development of local communes, combined with diverse economic models driven by intense local politics, has forced a stark reality upon the people: the Commune's economy needs reform. Yet, concerning its future, every faction holds its own view, and even within factions, there are fierce debates over economic models. The Syndicalists attempted economic reforms during their term, only to leave behind a mess. With the CSP and the BGT having little control over local authorities, a unified economic reform remains almost a fantasy.\n\nThe Delegate for Economic Affairs occupies an awkward position. On one hand, they act as the national economic bellwether directing reform; on the other, their ideas are rarely implemented in practice. Despite the title of 'National Economic Commander,' it is still the local councils and assemblies that truly influence the economy.

Our forefathers fostered within the organisation a pluralist, big tent attitude:0 anarchists, communists, socialists, syndicalists, pacifists, anti-colonialists, even some social democrats were convened, in the hopes of rebuilding the foundations of the global proletarian movement, battered by the war years. Every year, then every few years, we have held congresses to discuss and direction the direction of the socialist struggle. We are proud to say we will soon be ready to hold the ninth edition of these meetings, right here, in and around Paris.

Parties affiliated with the Internationale, as well as some sympathisers and observers, were invited to send representatives and hundreds made the sometimes arduous journey to be closest to the beating heart of the proletarian Revolution. Though the Internationale has in theory no relation to the French and British governments, representatives from these foremost socialist nations will certainly enjoy a position of informal seniority among their peers, elders in the global liberation of the labouring class."

Given the honour of pronouncing the introductory speech, father of the British revolution George Lansbury pointed out the irony of convening proletarian forces in what was once the centre of the autocratic monarchy, proof if any was needed of the unstoppable march forward of the Revolution. A grand speech followed, thanking the delegates, evoking the revolutionary successes of recent years and rousing spirits for the coming struggle. In his closing remarks, Lansbury invited the delegates to join him in a minute of prayer, to which a French voice promptly responded “Like hell we will!”, leading to a few moments of agitation in the audience. The old man was nevertheless abundantly applauded, and the representatives separated into various discussion groups and committees."

The Spanish revolutionaries have seen a White Terror, violent counter-revolutionary actions taking against the workers, first-hand.

Now a well-respected voice in the movement, he has announced his bid in the 1936 presidential election for the SPA. Despite criticism at home and abroad that this would draw him towards reformism, the prospect of seeing a staunch socialist at the helm of the United States is too enticing for any fellow delegates to voice much concern, and Reed was given a warm welcome by the Congress. In his speech, he detailed the current situation in the United States:0 the Great Depression, now dragging on for years, has thrown American workers and farmers into atrocious conditions, leading to a rapid rise in radical politics, made worse by the German crash. The labour movement grows ever more powerful, the SPA is rapidly gaining ground in political institutions, and proletarian forces are holding strong against police repression and Longist reactionary militias:0 an opportunity seems bound to reveal itself."

Every day more workers join the struggle of this frontline of imperialism, and if we are to believe our comrades the entire continent is one push away from Liberation. A packed audience listened eagerly to heroic tales of Patagonian revolutionaries, latest updates from the still fresh Nicaraguan revolution or stories from veterans of the Mexican Revolution, which inspired the whole of Latin America. Delegates from other nations, like Brazil or Cuba, gave detailed presentations on the state of the proletarian struggle in their own countries, with many feeling very much optimistic for their prospects in the coming years."

French and British governments held highly secretive talks, and slowly, but surely one realisation came to all:0 now might be the hour, now might be the moment, a tremendous effort must be undertaken. However, what exactly this tremendous effort would be proved controversial and when the Congress finally reassembled for a voting session, debates lasted well into the night, with positions ranging from issuing a mere condemnation to calls for immediate armed struggle.\n\nUltimately, it was decided that a framework for deeper international collaboration would soon be established under the auspices of the Third Internationale and socialist great powers. Help towards the development of socialist economies, greater economic integration, research and development programs, as well as permanent international cooperation councils would help the world's free nations act as one to prepare for the final struggle. Simultaneously, initiatives to more concretely support socialist efforts in capitalist nations would be undertaken, both openly and covertly. Naturally, details would still be left for governments to fill in, but the proposal was approved almost unanimously. Only one thing was left to vote on, the name of this initiative. A French delegate proposed the 'Phalanstère', in homage to the harmonious and self-sustaining communities established by utopian socialist Charles Fourier, a proposal which proved instantly popular:0 by building this International Phalanstère, the workers of the world will soon conquer the utopia they have earned."

Many delegates came forward to deliver their final remarks and thank their comrades.\n\nWhen they come home, the delegates will have to grapple with the consequences of one of the greatest event since the revolutions, certainly an opportunity for decisive action. But before that, a ceremony was organised to properly send them off. On the Montmartre hill, birthplace of the 1871 Commune of Paris, a great performance open to the public was given, showcasing the best French artists, regional costumes and traditions, as well as athletic feats and technological innovations. It was followed by an immense banquet of dishes from all around the Commune for the many delegates, which lasted until well into the night.

We know that the Commune of France, together with the Union of Britain, has established an Anti-Colonial Committee in the Internationale. This committee, with the help of Mohamed Saïl, a traitor of the Algerian people living in France, is coordinating the efforts made by the syndicalists in supporting anti-colonial sentiments in our African holdings.\n\nThe syndicalist powers have sent significant amounts of weapons and material to support the native rebels. They have also opened a few training camps in their southernmost parts of the country. While the more oblivious politicians in our country believe that nothing will come out of this, our generals warn us that we have to be wary."

Our intelligence reports show that a small influx of Egyptian left-wing radicals who want to fight for the revolutionary cause are also arriving on French territory. While we are not at war with the Commune of France or any syndicalist country for now, we should be very cautious."

As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause. The initiative also plays in with Egypt's attempt to foster Arab nationalism in the Middle East and North Africa, and might strengthen our rival. For these reasons, we have to be cautious, even if we won't be a main target."

With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries.

 france_events.163.desc:0 "In 1889, delegates of the Second International voted for the designation of the 1st of May as a day of mobilisation to be repeated yearly. A proposal by the father of French Marxism Jules Guesde, the date was chosen to commemorate the martyrs of the Haymarket Massacre, killed for having dared to demand an eight hours work day. Years and after years, intense mobilisation on this day led to more street confrontations, often more victims. On this International Workers' Day, soon known colloquially as Labour Day, proletarians refused to work, and marched for their rights, waving the red flag, singing the Internationale, wearing the red eglantine or the lily of the valley wrapped in scarlet cloth on their jackets in memory of the bloodshed. This commemorative, oppositional holiday, this day of freedom snatched from the jaws of Capital, rightfully shook the bourgeoisie.\n\nWith the Revolution, the First of May was declared a national holiday and quickly became a day of great official celebrations and commemorations, marches, popular events and dances. At home, a celebration of the Revolution and the liberated workers, abroad still a day of struggle, until one day the wind of revolutionary freedom blows on all corners of the Earth. Our people rejoice and remember the long road travelled:0 once a mere dream held onto dearly in the factories, the Revolution now lives, thrives, its heart beating proudly in France, an inspiration for all of our comrades still shackled."

The famous German physicist Albert Einstein had previously warned that a successful 'nuclear bomb' might even be able to turn entire cities into ash.\n\nGerman intelligence agencies have shared the information about this project to their closest allies, so naturally the whole world now knows.

 france_events.301.desc:0 "The war has most decidedly not developed to our advantage. Despite the best efforts of us and our soldiers, the forces of reaction have proven to be too much for the power of the international proletariat - suffering a long string of setbacks and defeats, the British and French militaries have had their fighting effectiveness steadily reduced throughout the course of the war. While we have held out hope until now that the workers of the world will still rise up, the situation has reached such a critical point that neither Britain or France can offer effective resistance to the opposing forces, and no surviving member of the Internationale has the necessary strength and prestige to rally the alliance - as such, the Third Internationale has begun to break down.\n\nThe effects of this can be felt almost immediately - what was previously a steadfast resolve to never give in to the reactionaries has now swiftly given way to an almost defeatist attitude, as allied insurgents and governments alike increasingly consider our cause hopeless and begin contemplating either hanging up their rifles or seeking some sort of terms with the enemy, and the Phalanstère and other organs of the Internationale have been rendered largely defunct. It is expected that, barring an unthinkable reversal, the now-former members of the alliance beyond the reach of enemy forces will soon cease open hostilities, while the rest will eventually be forced to surrender unconditionally... or otherwise suffer eventual debellation.\n\nAs the flame of revolution burns out and the workers cry in despair, all that remains is to find whatever salvation we can..."
