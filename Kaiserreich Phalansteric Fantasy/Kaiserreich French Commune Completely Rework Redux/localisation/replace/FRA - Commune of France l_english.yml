  FRA_country_intro_header:0 "Commune of France"
  FRA_country_intro_content:0 "On June 25th, 1919, the Third Republic collapsed under the combined pressures of the Great War and internal strikes. Aristide Briand, leader of the Républicain Socialiste, rose to power and declared "peace in three months," signing the Matignon Agreement to end the strikes. But following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, a military coup led by Philippe Pétain dismantled the Left Republic, and named Joseph Joffre—previously forced into retirement under Briand—"Marshal of the Nation", granting him executive powers. Joffre immediately repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, issued a general mobilization, arrested and executed Briand for treason, outlawed the SFIO and the CGT, and revoked all reforms established in the Matignon Agreement.\n\nGeorges Sorel, who had long advocated peace during the war, called for total revolution and used his influence in the army to launch a "general mutiny." Though initially suppressed, the CGT’s moderates reconciled with its radicals and joined Sorel's revolutionary forces, mobilizing workers to resist the bourgeois regime. Meanwhile, the center-left in Parliament rejected the coup and openly denounced Joffre’s rule. Eventually, civil war broke out, and within a few short months, the republican government was expelled from metropolitan France by the alliance of Sorelian troops, the CGT, and the center-left.\n\nAfter the revolution, Georges Sorel became the first Chairman of the Commune, but due to declining health, he later stepped into an honorary role. The CGT assumed leadership of the revolution. Amid the political chaos and economic devastation caused by war and civil war—especially the collapse of centralized governance—the new socialist regime adopted a compromised dual-track "Parliament-Committee" system. The 1921 Constitution of the Fédération des Communes de France (FCF) formally established a syndicalist-socialist federal republic, while the "National Economic Reconstruction and Defense of the Revolution Act" institutionalized the role of the Comité de Salut Public (CSP). Although initially regarded as a temporary organ for national reconstruction, the CSP oversaw so much of the rebuilding that many began to argue for its permanence. Although the Bourse Générale du Travail (BGT) debated abolishing the CSP several times, no such proposals ever passed.\n\nThus, the Commune of France has continued to operate under this "temporary" political system, and in the years that followed, it demonstrated the strengths of socialism: the economy not only recovered but rapidly grew. The capitalist class that once exploited workers had vanished, and many workers became prosperous—despite various problems with the Commune’s monetary and financial systems, most people's lives markedly improved. As more citizens became politically conscious, factions critical of the CSR's dominance gradually emerged. While most failed to unseat CSR control, they secured a place within Commune politics.\n\nThe 1934 "Trial of the CGT" fractured the ruling alliance, leading to the split between the Comité Syndical Révolutionnaire (CSR) and the Association des Fédéralistes Anarchistes (AFA), and forming a new alliance between the AFA and the Parti Communiste Ouvrier et Paysan (PCOP). Meanwhile, the opposition bloc, composed of the Parti Socialiste de France (PSF) and the Confédération Nationale-Syndicaliste (CNS), saw a chance to replace the CSR. In 1936, then-Chairman of the CSP Marceau Pivert was impeached, triggering early elections. Perhaps this time, the syndicalist regime will finally come to an end..."

  comfrance.1.t:0 "A New Flag for the Federation?"
  comfrance.1.desc:0 "The question of the federal flag has stood out as a point of long-standing disagreements since the revolutionary days. The red flag, of course, had always been the flag of the proletariat, the flag of the martyrs, the flag of the barricades, and many argued that the Revolution should only fly these colours, a proud declaration of war against the bourgeoisie:0 proletarians have no motherland, after all. However, even though the Tricolour had not been the flag of revolutionary enthusiasm for decades and had degenerated into being merely the flag of the bankers' republic, the flag of the Versaillais of 1871, many felt too attached to it to let it go. Part of the socialist movement, particularly within the SFIO, had long sought to reconquer this flag from the hands of the bourgeois and give it back the same vigour it had when the People faced the monarchs of Europe at Valmy and triumphed. Or they simply worried that abandoning the Red, White and Blue would be too much of a provocation to the world, and to our compatriots who had not fully become comrades just yet.\n\nAnd so a compromise was found, much like in every aspect of the Revolution. The Tricolour was conserved, but was defaced with the symbols of the proletarian struggle, of the workers, of the mutineers, and was always flown alongside the red flag. With our victory in the latest elections, we have been given a popular mandate to finally settle this debate:0 should we keep the compromise of 1920 and the defaced Tricolour, forge a new, redder compromise flag, or simply enshrine the Red once and for all?"

  comfrance.6.desc:0 "Since the Great War, public enthusiasm for military service has waned, and many new recruits are simply 're-employed' citizens with little skill or motivation. These individuals are ill-suited to uphold the banner of the Commune’s army. Military reform is urgently needed. However, opinions on the future of the armed forces are divided. Some believe the army is a remnant of oppression and call for its complete dissolution, to be replaced with fragile militia formations.\n\nEven within the army itself, divisions run deep. The existence of 'military unions' has politicized the army, leading to endless debate over whether the army exists to defend national sovereignty or to serve as the vanguard of syndicalist revolution. The officer corps is split into three factions: the conservative faction, which favors the status quo; the nationalist faction, which supports depoliticizing the army; and the revolutionary faction, which envisions the military as the frontline of socialist struggle. The Syndicalists typically align with the conservatives, while the Worker-Peasant Opposition maintains ties with the nationalists. But it is the Sorelians who exert the greatest influence on the military—not only do they enjoy support among senior officers, but their doctrine of 'warrior culture' resonates deeply with the rank-and-file.\n\nJust days before the new CSP elections, the widely respected General Gamelin, a hero of the civil war, declined to stand as the Syndicalist candidate. This has left the Syndicalists scrambling to find a replacement. Meanwhile, the previously marginal Jacobins have found new allies for this contest. The race for Chief of Staff is now wide open."

  comfrance.9.desc:0 "How should one describe the current state of the Commune’s economy? Chaos seems to be the one consensus among all factions. Ever since its founding, the Commune has failed to develop a unified, nationwide economic system due to rampant localism. Although the revolutionaries swiftly seized the national banks to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Paris Commune, true monetary unification was not achieved until 1925. The rapid, uncoordinated growth of local communes and their diverging political leanings resulted in wildly different economic models across the country. One fact is now clear to all: the economy must be reformed.\n\nEach faction—and even factions within factions—has its own vision for the future of the economy. The Syndicalists attempted reforms during their tenure, but the results were disastrous. With both the Comité de Salut Public and the BGT lacking real control over the localities, any attempt at nationwide reform borders on fantasy.\n\nThe Delegate for Economic Affairs thus holds a paradoxical role—tasked with spearheading reforms yet powerless to implement them directly. Despite bearing the title of 'national economic director,' the real levers of economic power remain in the hands of local councils and assemblies. Nonetheless, the position remains highly sought after, as securing it could rally moderate elements to a faction’s economic vision."

Domestically, their reach is limited. Nonetheless, aside from the BGT’s role as head of state, the foreign delegate is the face of the Commune's diplomacy. A clever and pragmatic diplomat is what we need. Accusations of corruption and betrayal of the revolution are often hurled at whoever holds this post, but such claims are rarely more than political slander. In truth, this position is always burdened with unreasonable expectations simply because its diplomacy may not align with others' ideological fantasies. Realpolitik is not child's play; we need someone who is clear-headed, not blinded by idealism. Under the CSP’s direct election system, all we can do is hope the people choose wisely."

Now a well-respected voice in the movement, he has announced his bid in the 1936 presidential election for the SPA. Despite criticism at home and abroad that this would draw him towards reformism, the prospect of seeing a staunch socialist at the helm of the United States is too enticing for any fellow delegates to voice much concern, and Reed was given a warm welcome by the Congress. In his speech, he detailed the current situation in the United States:0 the Great Depression, now dragging on for years, has thrown American workers and farmers into atrocious conditions, leading to a rapid rise in radical politics, made worse by the German crash. The labour movement grows ever more powerful, the SPA is rapidly gaining ground in political institutions, and proletarian forces are holding strong against police repression and Longist reactionary militias:0 an opportunity seems bound to reveal itself."

Every day more workers join the struggle of this frontline of imperialism, and if we are to believe our comrades the entire continent is one push away from Liberation. A packed audience listened eagerly to heroic tales of Patagonian revolutionaries, latest updates from the still fresh Nicaraguan revolution or stories from veterans of the Mexican Revolution, which inspired the whole of Latin America. Delegates from other nations, like Brazil or Cuba, gave detailed presentations on the state of the proletarian struggle in their own countries, with many feeling very much optimistic for their prospects in the coming years."

French and British governments held highly secretive talks, and slowly, but surely one realisation came to all:0 now might be the hour, now might be the moment, a tremendous effort must be undertaken. However, what exactly this tremendous effort would be proved controversial and when the Congress finally reassembled for a voting session, debates lasted well into the night, with positions ranging from issuing a mere condemnation to calls for immediate armed struggle.\n\nUltimately, it was decided that a framework for deeper international collaboration would soon be established under the auspices of the Third Internationale and socialist great powers. Help towards the development of socialist economies, greater economic integration, research and development programs, as well as permanent international cooperation councils would help the world's free nations act as one to prepare for the final struggle. Simultaneously, initiatives to more concretely support socialist efforts in capitalist nations would be undertaken, both openly and covertly. Naturally, details would still be left for governments to fill in, but the proposal was approved almost unanimously. Only one thing was left to vote on, the name of this initiative. A French delegate proposed the 'Phalanstère', in homage to the harmonious and self-sustaining communities established by utopian socialist Charles Fourier, a proposal which proved instantly popular:0 by building this International Phalanstère, the workers of the world will soon conquer the utopia they have earned."

The final vote of the delegates concerned the location of the next congress, and though many cities were proposed it was ultimately decided that it would take place in London, the other great socialist capital. Many delegates came forward to deliver their final remarks and thank their comrades.\n\nWhen they come home, the delegates will have to grapple with the consequences of one of the greatest event since the revolutions, certainly an opportunity for decisive action. But before that, a ceremony was organised to properly send them off. On the Montmartre hill, birthplace of the 1871 Commune of Paris, a great performance open to the public was given, showcasing the best French artists, regional costumes and traditions, as well as athletic feats and technological innovations. It was followed by an immense banquet of dishes from all around the Commune for the many delegates, which lasted until well into the night.

This committee, with the help of Mohamed Saïl, a traitor of the Algerian people living in France, is coordinating the efforts made by the syndicalists in supporting anti-colonial sentiments in our African holdings.\n\nThe syndicalist powers have sent significant amounts of weapons and material to support the native rebels. They have also opened a few training camps in their southernmost parts of the country. While the more oblivious politicians in our country believe that nothing will come out of this, our generals warn us that we have to be wary."

The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. Our intelligence reports show that a small influx of Egyptian left-wing radicals who want to fight for the revolutionary cause are also arriving on French territory. While we are not at war with the Commune of France or any syndicalist country for now, we should be very cautious."

The Committee aims to support the cause of Arabs and Africans in liberating their homelands from the hands of the colonial powers, particularly the remnants of the French state.\nThis body will coordinate the syndicalist powers' actions in North and West Africa. As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause. The initiative also plays in with Egypt's attempt to foster Arab nationalism in the Middle East and North Africa, and might strengthen our rival. For these reasons, we have to be cautious, even if we won't be a main target."

Years and after years, intense mobilisation on this day led to more street confrontations, often more victims. On this International Workers' Day, soon known colloquially as Labour Day, proletarians refused to work, and marched for their rights, waving the red flag, singing the Internationale, wearing the red eglantine or the lily of the valley wrapped in scarlet cloth on their jackets in memory of the bloodshed. This commemorative, oppositional holiday, this day of freedom snatched from the jaws of Capital, rightfully shook the bourgeoisie.\n\nWith the Revolution, the First of May was declared a national holiday and quickly became a day of great official celebrations and commemorations, marches, popular events and dances. At home, a celebration of the Revolution and the liberated workers, abroad still a day of struggle, until one day the wind of revolutionary freedom blows on all corners of the Earth.

While we have held out hope until now that the workers of the world will still rise up, the situation has reached such a critical point that neither Britain or France can offer effective resistance to the opposing forces, and no surviving member of the Internationale has the necessary strength and prestige to rally the alliance - as such, the Third Internationale has begun to break down.\n\nThe effects of this can be felt almost immediately - what was previously a steadfast resolve to never give in to the reactionaries has now swiftly given way to an almost defeatist attitude, as allied insurgents and governments alike increasingly consider our cause hopeless and begin contemplating either hanging up their rifles or seeking some sort of terms with the enemy, and the Phalanstère and other organs of the Internationale have been rendered largely defunct. It is expected that, barring an unthinkable reversal, the now-former members of the alliance beyond the reach of enemy forces will soon cease open hostilities, while the rest will eventually be forced to surrender unconditionally... or otherwise suffer eventual debellation.\n\nAs the flame of revolution burns out and the workers cry in despair, all that remains is to find whatever salvation we can..."
